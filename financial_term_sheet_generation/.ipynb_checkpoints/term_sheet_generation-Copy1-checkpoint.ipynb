    "default_text=f'''In a negotiation between XYZ Tech Solutions, which provides IT software for financial companies, and ABC Ventures, the focus was on a $2,000,000 equity investment with clear, numerical benchmarks. XYZ Tech, with an EBITDA of $1.2M last year, argued for an $8M pre-money valuation. ABC's investment would shift this to a $10M post-money valuation, granting ABC a 20% stake. The investment terms were sharply defined: Series A Preferred Stock carrying an 8% annual dividend, contingent on XYZ's EBITDA growth of at least 12% per year. As security for a potential loan, XYZ has listed its office buildings and land holdings, which are worth $3,000,000.\n",

    "The proposed term sheet included a full-ratchet anti-dilution clause to protect ABC against devaluation, governance rights including a board seat and veto power on expenditures over $250,000, and quarterly financial audits to ABC. A five-year redemption clause was agreed upon, allowing ABC to exit with a 12% premium if XYZ's EBITDA grows by 20% within the period. This conversation framed a deal focused on financial health, growth metrics, and strategic alignment, streamlining the partnership terms into a concise, numbers-driven term sheet.\n",
