    "# Use AI21 Jamba Instruct to create Loan Term Sheet Agreements\n",
    "When creating loan agreements, Financial Instituions (e.g. Credit Unions, Commercial Banks, Brokerage Firms etc.) need to create [Term Sheets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termsheet.asp#:~:text=A%20term%20sheet%20is%20a%20nonbinding%20agreement%20outlining%20the%20basic,with%20capital%20to%20fund%20enterprises) ; a non-binding agreement that outlines the terms of a loan. Writing terms sheets can be laborious and complex, and can involve extracting different points of information from call transcripts, company documents, and other sources of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, AI21 Contextual Answers is used to extract key information about the potential loan. This is then passed to a chain of Jamba-Instruct Foundation Model calls, which will first create an initial draft term sheet, criticise it if it is missing any important sections, and then accordingly adjust it. The finalized term sheet is then generated in the final text box. This is schematically shown below as:\n",

    "raw_notes=f'''In a negotiation between XYZ Tech Solutions, which provides IT software for financial companies, and ABC Ventures, the focus was on a $2,000,000 equity investment with clear, numerical benchmarks. XYZ Tech, with an EBITDA of $1.2M last year, argued for an $8M pre-money valuation. ABC's investment would shift this to a $10M post-money valuation, granting ABC a 20% stake. The investment terms were sharply defined: Series A Preferred Stock carrying an 8% annual dividend, contingent on XYZ's EBITDA growth of at least 12% per year. As security for a potential loan, XYZ has listed its office buildings and land holdings, which are worth $3,000,000.\n",

    "The proposed term sheet included a full-ratchet anti-dilution clause to protect ABC against devaluation, governance rights including a board seat and veto power on expenditures over $250,000, and quarterly financial audits to ABC. A five-year redemption clause was agreed upon, allowing ABC to exit with a 12% premium if XYZ's EBITDA grows by 20% within the period. This conversation framed a deal focused on financial health, growth metrics, and strategic alignment, streamlining the partnership terms into a concise, numbers-driven term sheet.\n",

Sixthly, there are no disclaimers mentioned, which could leave room for misinterpretation or unexpected liabilities.
