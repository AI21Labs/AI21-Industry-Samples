KEY POINTS

* Google unveiled its latest lineup of hardware products on Wednesday, including its first foldable phone and a new tablet, as well as plans to roll out new AI features to its search engine and productivity tools.  Google unveiled the Pixel Fold, a foldable smartphone that opens up to reveal a 7.6-inch screen. It has a vertical hinge that can be opened to reveal a tablet-like display, and a custom-built 180-degree hinge. The Google Fold includes features you'd find on a Pixel, such as long exposure, unblur, magic eraser, and dual-screen live translate. It also has Pixel Fold-specific tools such as fast audio and text translations on the outer screen.

* Google is far from the first to embrace foldables, but its version is likely to have issues with the screen and most apps are not well optimized for the design. The foldable phone market is relatively small, with Samsung dominating the category, followed by Motorola, Lenovo, Oppo, and Huawei.

* The Pixel 7a looks similar to the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, but offers advanced processing and new artificial intelligence features. It also offers wireless charging. The Pixel 7a offers a 64-megapixel main camera, a 13-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and a 13-megapixel front camera. Each camera enables 4K video.

* Google sells between eight and 10 million Pixel devices each year, but its reach is limited. Google has purposely kept volume sales limited to showcase how software, and now AI capabilities, could be effectively optimized on hardware.

* Google is introducing a new 11-inch tablet, the Pixel C, which is powered by Tensor G2 chips and offers AI features. The company is also introducing the next evolution of Google Search, which will use an AI-powered chatbot to answer questions. Users can now sign up for the new Google Search via the Google app or Chrome's desktop browser. Google is expanding access to its chatbot Bard, which can help users do tasks such as outline and write essay drafts, plan a friend's baby shower, and get lunch ideas based on what's in the fridge.
