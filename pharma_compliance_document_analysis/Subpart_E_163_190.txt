§211.86 Use of approved components, drug product containers, and clo- sures.
Components, drug product con- tainers, and closures approved for use shall be rotated so that the oldest ap- proved stock is used first. Deviation from this requirement is permitted if such deviation is temporary and appro- priate.
§211.87 Retesting of approved compo- nents, drug product containers, and closures.
Components, drug product con- tainers, and closures shall be retested or reexamined, as appropriate, for iden- tity, strength, quality, and purity and approved or rejected by the quality control unit in accordance with §211.84 as necessary, e.g., after storage for long periods or after exposure to air, heat or other conditions that might ad- versely affect the component, drug product container, or closure.
§211.89 Rejected components, drug product containers, and closures.
Rejected components, drug product containers, and closures shall be iden- tified and controlled under a quar- antine system designed to prevent their use in manufacturing or proc- essing operations for which they are unsuitable.
§211.94 Drug product containers and closures.
(a) Drug product containers and clo- sures shall not be reactive, additive, or absorptive so as to alter the safety, identity, strength, quality, or purity of the drug beyond the official or estab- lished requirements.
(b) Container closure systems shall provide adequate protection against foreseeable external factors in storage and use that can cause deterioration or contamination of the drug product.
(c) Drug product containers and clo- sures shall be clean and, where indi- cated by the nature of the drug, steri-
§ 211.94
lized and processed to remove pyrogenic properties to assure that they are suitable for their intended use. Such depyrogenation processes shall be validated.
(d) Standards or specifications, meth- ods of testing, and, where indicated, methods of cleaning, sterilizing, and processing to remove pyrogenic prop- erties shall be written and followed for drug product containers and closures.
(e) Medical gas containers and closures must meet the following requirements—(1) Gas-specific use outlet connections. Port- able cryogenic medical gas containers that are not manufactured with perma- nent gas use outlet connections (e.g., those that have been silver-brazed) must have gas-specific use outlet con- nections that are attached to the valve body so that they cannot be readily re- moved or replaced (without making the valve inoperable and preventing the containers’ use) except by the manu- facturer. For the purposes of this para- graph, the term ‘‘manufacturer’’ in- cludes any individual or firm that fills high-pressure medical gas cylinders or cryogenic medical gas containers. For the purposes of this section, a ‘‘port- able cryogenic medical gas container’’ is one that is capable of being trans- ported and is intended to be attached to a medical gas supply system within a hospital, health care entity, nursing home, other facility, or home health care setting, or is a base unit used to fill small cryogenic gas containers for use by individual patients. The term does not include cryogenic containers that are not designed to be connected to a medical gas supply system, e.g., tank trucks, trailers, rail cars, or small cryogenic gas containers for use by individual patients (including port- able liquid oxygen units as defined at § 868.5655 of this chapter).
(2) Label and coloring requirements. The labeling specified at §201.328(a) of this chapter must be affixed to the con- tainer in a manner that does not inter- fere with other labeling and such that it is not susceptible to becoming worn or inadvertently detached during nor- mal use. Each such label as well as ma- terials used for coloring medical gas containers must be reasonably resist- ant to fading, durable when exposed to

Such control procedures shall be estab- lished to monitor the output and to validate the performance of those man- ufacturing processes that may be re- sponsible for causing variability in the characteristics of in-process material and the drug product. Such control procedures shall include, but are not limited to, the following, where appro- priate:
(1) Tablet or capsule weight vari- ation;
(2) Disintegration time;
(3) Adequacy of mixing to assure uni- formity and homogeneity;
(4) Dissolution time and rate;
(5) Clarity, completeness, or pH of so- lutions.
(6) Bioburden testing.
(b) Valid in-process specifications for such characteristics shall be consistent with drug product final specifications and shall be derived from previous ac- ceptable process average and process variability estimates where possible and determined by the application of suitable statistical procedures where appropriate. Examination and testing of samples shall assure that the drug product and in-process material con- form to specifications.
(c) In-process materials shall be test- ed for identity, strength, quality, and purity as appropriate, and approved or rejected by the quality control unit, during the production process, e.g., at commencement or completion of sig- nificant phases or after storage for long periods.
(d) Rejected in-process materials shall be identified and controlled under a quarantine system designed to pre- vent their use in manufacturing or
§ 211.122

§211.132 Tamper-evident packaging requirements for over-the-counter (OTC) human drug products.
(a) General. The Food and Drug Ad- ministration has the authority under
§ 211.132
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) to establish a uniform na- tional requirement for tamper-evident packaging of OTC drug products that will improve the security of OTC drug packaging and help assure the safety and effectiveness of OTC drug products. An OTC drug product (except a der- matological, dentifrice, insulin, or loz- enge product) for retail sale that is not packaged in a tamper-resistant pack- age or that is not properly labeled under this section is adulterated under section 501 of the act or misbranded under section 502 of the act, or both.
(b) Requirements for tamper-evident package. (1) Each manufacturer and packer who packages an OTC drug product (except a dermatological, den- tifrice, insulin, or lozenge product) for retail sale shall package the product in a tamper-evident package, if this prod- uct is accessible to the public while held for sale. A tamper-evident pack- age is one having one or more indica- tors or barriers to entry which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering has oc- curred. To reduce the likelihood of suc- cessful tampering and to increase the likelihood that consumers will discover if a product has been tampered with, the package is required to be distinc- tive by design or by the use of one or more indicators or barriers to entry that employ an identifying char- acteristic (e.g., a pattern, name, reg- istered trademark, logo, or picture). For purposes of this section, the term ‘‘distinctive by design’’ means the packaging cannot be duplicated with commonly available materials or through commonly available processes. A tamper-evident package may involve an immediate-container and closure system or secondary-container or car- ton system or any combination of sys- tems intended to provide a visual indi- cation of package integrity. The tam- per-evident feature shall be designed to and shall remain intact when handled in a reasonable manner during manu- facture, distribution, and retail dis- play.
(2) In addition to the tamper-evident packaging feature described in para- graph (b)(1) of this section, any two- piece, hard gelatin capsule covered by

§ 211.134
this section must be sealed using an ac- ceptable tamper-evident technology.
(c) Labeling. (1) In order to alert con- sumers to the specific tamper-evident feature(s) used, each retail package of an OTC drug product covered by this section (except ammonia inhalant in crushable glass ampules, containers of compressed medical oxygen, or aerosol products that depend upon the power of a liquefied or compressed gas to expel the contents from the container) is re- quired to bear a statement that:
(i) Identifies all tamper-evident fea- ture(s) and any capsule sealing tech- nologies used to comply with para- graph (b) of this section;
(ii) Is prominently placed on the package; and
(iii) Is so placed that it will be unaf- fected if the tamper-evident feature of the package is breached or missing.
(2) If the tamper-evident feature cho- sen to meet the requirements in para- graph (b) of this section uses an identi- fying characteristic, that char- acteristic is required to be referred to in the labeling statement. For exam- ple, the labeling statement on a bottle with a shrink band could say ‘‘For your protection, this bottle has an im- printed seal around the neck.’’
(d) Request for exemptions from pack- aging and labeling requirements. A man- ufacturer or packer may request an ex- emption from the packaging and label- ing requirements of this section. A re- quest for an exemption is required to be submitted in the form of a citizen petition under §10.30 of this chapter and should be clearly identified on the envelope as a ‘‘Request for Exemption from the Tamper-Evident Packaging Rule.’’ The petition is required to con- tain the following:
(1) The name of the drug product or, if the petition seeks an exemption for a drug class, the name of the drug class, and a list of products within that class.
(2) The reasons that the drug prod- uct’s compliance with the tamper-evi- dent packaging or labeling require- ments of this section is unnecessary or cannot be achieved.
(3) A description of alternative steps that are available, or that the peti- tioner has already taken, to reduce the likelihood that the product or drug
21 CFR Ch. I (4–1–22 Edition)
class will be the subject of malicious adulteration.
(4) Other information justifying an exemption.
(e) OTC drug products subject to ap- proved new drug applications. Holders of approved new drug applications for OTC drug products are required under §314.70 of this chapter to provide the agency with notification of changes in packaging and labeling to comply with the requirements of this section. Changes in packaging and labeling re- quired by this regulation may be made before FDA approval, as provided under §314.70(c) of this chapter. Manufac- turing changes by which capsules are to be sealed require prior FDA approval under § 314.70(b) of this chapter.
(f) Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970. This section does not affect any requirements for ‘‘special packaging’’ as defined under §310.3(l) of this chap- ter and required under the Poison Pre- vention Packaging Act of 1970.

(a) Packaged and labeled products shall be examined during finishing op- erations to provide assurance that con- tainers and packages in the lot have the correct label.
(b) A representative sample of units shall be collected at the completion of finishing operations and shall be vis- ually examined for correct labeling.
(c) Results of these examinations shall be recorded in the batch produc- tion or control records.
§ 211.137 Expiration dating.
(a) To assure that a drug product meets applicable standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity at the time of use, it shall bear an expiration date determined by appropriate sta- bility testing described in § 211.166.
(b) Expiration dates shall be related to any storage conditions stated on the labeling, as determined by stability studies described in § 211.166.

the components, containers, and clo- sures are suitable for their intended use.
(b) Written specifications. You must establish appropriate written specifica- tions for the identity, quality, and pu- rity of components and for the identity and quality of drug product containers and closures.
(c) Examination and testing. Upon re- ceipt, each lot of components and con- tainers and closures must be uniquely identified and tested or examined to determine whether the lot complies with your specifications. You must not use in PET drug production any lot that does not meet its specifications, including any expiration date if appli- cable, or that has not yet received its material release. Any incoming lot must be appropriately designated as quarantined, accepted, or rejected. You must use a reliable supplier as a source of each lot of each component, con- tainer, and closure.
(1)(i) If you conduct finished-product testing of a PET drug product that in- cludes testing to ensure that the cor- rect components have been used, you must determine that each lot of incom- ing components used in that PET drug product complies with written speci- fications by examining a certificate of analysis provided by the supplier. You are not required to perform a specific identity test on any of those compo- nents.
(ii) If you do not conduct finished- product testing of a PET drug product that ensures that the correct compo- nents have been used, you must con- duct identity testing on each lot of a component that yields an active ingre- dient and each lot of an inactive ingre- dient used in that PET drug product. This testing must be conducted using tests that are specific to each compo- nent that yields an active ingredient and each inactive ingredient. For any other component, such as a solvent or reagent, that is not the subject of fin- ished-product testing, you must deter- mine that each lot complies with writ- ten specifications by examining a cer- tificate of analysis provided by the sup- plier; if you use such a component to prepare an inactive ingredient on site, you must perform an identity test on the components used to make the inac-
§ 212.50
tive ingredient before the components are released for use. However, if you use as an inactive ingredient a product that is approved under section 505 of the act (21 U.S.C. 355) and is marketed as a finished drug product intended for intravenous administration, you need not perform a specific identity test on that ingredient.

(e) Sterility testing. Sterility testing need not be completed before final re- lease but must be started within 30 hours after completion of production. The 30-hour requirement may be ex- ceeded due to a weekend or holiday. If the sample for sterility testing is held longer than 30 hours, you must dem- onstrate that the longer period does not adversely affect the sample and the test results obtained will be equivalent to test results that would have been obtained if the test had been started within the 30-hour time period. Tested samples must be from individual batches and not pooled. If the product fails to meet a criterion for sterility, you must immediately notify all facili- ties that received the product of the test results and provide any appro- priate recommendations. The notifica- tion must be documented. Upon com- pletion of an investigation into the failure to meet a criterion for sterility, you must notify all facilities that re- ceived the product of the findings from the investigation.
(f) Conditional final release. (1) If you cannot complete one of the required
21 CFR Ch. I (4–1–22 Edition)
finished-product tests for a batch of a PET drug product because of a mal- function involving analytical equip- ment, you may approve the conditional final release of the product if you meet the following conditions:
(i) You have data documenting that preceding consecutive batches, pro- duced using the same methods used for the conditionally released batch, dem- onstrate that the conditionally re- leased batch will likely meet the estab- lished specifications;
(ii) You determine that all other ac- ceptance criteria are met;
(iii) You retain a reserve sample of the conditionally released batch of drug product;
(iv) You promptly correct the mal- function of analytical equipment, com- plete the omitted test using the reserve sample after the malfunction is cor- rected, and document that reasonable efforts have been made to prevent re- currence of the malfunction;
(v) If you obtain an out-of-specifica- tion result when testing the reserve sample, you immediately notify the re- ceiving facility; and
(vi) You document all actions regard- ing the conditional final release of the drug product, including the justifica- tion for the release, all followup ac- tions, results of completed testing, all notifications, and corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the malfunction involving analytical equipment.
(2) Even if the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section are met, you may not approve the conditional final re- lease of the product if the malfunction involving analytical equipment pre- vents the performance of a radiochemical identity/purity test or prevents the determination of the prod- uct’s specific activity.
(3) You may not release another batch of the PET drug product until you have corrected the problem con- cerning the malfunction of analytical equipment and completed the omitted finished-product test.
§212.71 What actions must I take if a batch of PET drug product does not conform to specifications?
