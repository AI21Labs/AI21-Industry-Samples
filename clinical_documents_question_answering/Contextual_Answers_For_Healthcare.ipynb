    "In the context of healthcare, the veracity of information is paramount. Accurate data is crucial for informed decision-making, enabling healthcare professionals to deliver quality care, reduce misdiagnoses, and prevent adverse events. This notebook shows how to use AI21's [Contextual Answers](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-gwbjdp3tmh3bw) model to derive grounded answers from healthcare documents. In this notebook, we focus on answering questions from patient healthcare records."
