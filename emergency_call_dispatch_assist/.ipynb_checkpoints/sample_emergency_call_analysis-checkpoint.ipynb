    "# Using AI21 Contextual Answers Support Emergency Call Dispatchers\n",
    "\n",
    "When receiving calls, emergency call dispatchers must quickly extract key information from civillians who are reporting an emergency. Given the stress and complex situation, callers are frequently confused or may not understand what is going on around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of emergency calls, dispatchers must find out the address where the caller is calling from, as well as the nature of the emergency. In the context of calls related to fires, dispatchers must quickly decide if the call is about a [working fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-alarm_fire), which would require a coordinated response from multiple fire departments, or a minor incident or false alarm. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how the [AI21 Contextual Answers](https://www.ai21.com/studio/contextual-answers) Task Specific model can be used to surface answers to these two important questions for dispatchers. Given a sample transcript of a call, Contextual Answers will surface the needed information. Importantly, such answers must fulfill two criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If no answer is present, no answer is surfaced\n",
    "2. The answer must be current to what the caller is saying **now**. This can alert the dispatcher if anything changes while the caller is on the line."
