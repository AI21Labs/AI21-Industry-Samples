It is a real heavyweight of power, in an always so light format.
Never has a chip went so far.
There she is. Our first chip specially designed for the Mac. The system on a M1 chip (SOC) designed by Apple brings together no less than 16 billion transistors and incorporates the central processor (CPU), the graphic processor (GPU), the neural engine, the E/S and many other elements On a single and tiny integrated circuit. With stunning performance, tailor -made technologies and the best energy efficiency on the market, the M1 chip is more than a simple evolution for the Mac. It’s a revolution.
Slaughter the work. Save the battery.
The M1 chip incorporates the fastest central processor that we have ever created. With such treatment power, the MacBook Air can now tackle extraordinarily intensive tasks, such as professional assembly or the most spectacular action games. And that's not all. In addition to being 3.5 times faster than its predecessor, the Eight Hearts of the M1 chip associates its high -performance hearts with high energy efficiency hearts, capable of slaughtering daily tasks while using ten times less 'energy.
Automatic learning
Up to 9x faster. Impressive, even for a neural Engine 16 hearts. On the MacBook Air, the apps can use automatic learning (ML) to automatically retouch photos such as pros, improve the accuracy of intelligent tools such as magic baguettes and audio filters for automatic detection, and much more. It is not a simple deployment of gray matter. It is the deployment of an entire arsenal of automatic learning technologies.
