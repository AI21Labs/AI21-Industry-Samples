(“CCB”) segment. The Firm’s wholesale business segments
are the Corporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”), Commercial

products and services they provide to their respective client

of Management’s discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations (“Management’s
discussion and analysis” or “MD&A”), beginning on page 46

Competition
JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in
highly competitive environments. Competitors include other
banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies,
merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading
companies, private equity firms, insurance companies,
mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card
companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies,
securities processing companies, automobile financing
companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other
internet-based companies, financial technology companies,
and other companies engaged in providing similar as well as

compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firm’s

reputation and price. Competition also varies based on the
types of clients, customers, industries and geographies
served. With respect to some of its geographies and
products, JPMorgan Chase competes globally; with respect to
others, the Firm competes on a national or regional basis.
New competitors in the financial services industry continue
to emerge, including firms that offer products and services
solely through the internet and non-financial companies that
offer products and services that disintermediate traditional
banking products and services offered by financial services
firms such as JPMorgan Chase.

Firm culture
The foundations of JPMorgan Chase’s culture are its core
values and How We Do Business Principles, which are
fundamental to the Firm’s success and are represented by
four central corporate tenets: exceptional client service;
operational excellence; a commitment to integrity, fairness
and responsibility; and cultivation of a great team and
winning culture. The Firm maintains its focus on its culture
of inclusion and respect, which is reinforced by its Code of
Conduct and by increasing employee awareness, education,
communication and training. An important part of these
efforts includes the Firm’s Business Resource Groups, which
are groups of employees who support JPMorgan Chase’s
diversity, equity and inclusion strategies by leveraging the
unique perspectives of their members. The Firm has global
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of excellence that lead
the Firm’s strategy in supporting its commitments to create
more equity and lasting impact in communities, and
strengthen its inclusive culture.
Attracting and retaining employees
The goal of JPMorgan Chase’s recruitment efforts is to
attract and hire talented individuals in all roles and at all
career levels. The Firm strives to provide both external
candidates and internal employees who are seeking a
different role with challenging and stimulating career
opportunities. These opportunities range from internship
training programs for students to entry-level, management
and executive careers. During 2022, approximately twothirds of the Firm’s employment opportunities were filled
by external candidates, with the remainder filled by existing
employees. In addition, depending on business needs, and
where appropriate, the Firm has implemented hybrid work
models which include a mix of on-site and remote work for
certain roles.
Diversity is an important area of focus throughout the
Firm’s hiring process. JPMorgan Chase engages in efforts
aimed at hiring diverse talent, including initiatives focused
on gender, underrepresented ethnic groups, LGBTQ+
individuals, people with disabilities, veterans and others.
The Firm’s global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of
excellence seek to increase representation of and advance
career opportunities for talented diverse individuals across
the Firm through initiatives such as career coaching and
mentorship.
JPMorgan Chase offers a competitive fellowship program
that seeks to attract accomplished individuals who have
taken a career break and wish to return to the workforce. In
addition, and where appropriate, the Firm’s hiring practices
focus on the skills of a job candidate rather than degrees
held.
Developing employees
JPMorgan Chase supports the professional development
and career growth of its employees. An onboarding training
curriculum is required for new hires, which covers, among
other topics, compliance with the Firm’s Code of Conduct
and information concerning Firm policies and standards,
including those relating to cybersecurity. In addition, the
Firm offers extensive training programs and educational
resources to all employees, covering a broad variety of
topics such as leadership, change management, analytical
thinking, culture and conduct, diversity, equity and
inclusion, and risk and controls. Leadership Edge, the Firm’s
global leadership and management development center of
excellence, is focused on creating one Firmwide leadership
culture.
Compensation and benefits
The Firm provides market-competitive compensation and
benefits programs. JPMorgan Chase’s compensation
philosophy includes guiding principles that drive
compensation-related decisions across the Firm, and
includes: pay-for-performance practices designed to attract
and retain top talent; responsiveness and alignment with
shareholder interests; and reinforcement of the Firm’s
culture and How We Do Business Principles, including the
integration of risk, controls and conduct considerations. The
Firm’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion for all
employees includes compensation review processes that
seek to ensure that the Firm’s employees are paid equitably
and competitively for the work they do.
The Firm also supports employees’ well-being. JPMorgan
Chase offers an extensive benefits and wellness package to
employees and their families, including healthcare
coverage, retirement benefits, life and disability insurance,
on-site health and wellness centers, counseling and
resources related to mental health, employee assistance
programs, competitive vacation and leave policies, backup
child care arrangements, tuition reimbursement programs,
and financial coaching. In 2022, the Firm implemented or
announced enhancements to certain health and wellness
benefits for U.S. employees, including expanded medical
plan coverage and paid time off policies related to parental,
critical caregiving and bereavement leaves.
3
Supervision and regulation
The Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive
regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as the
applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which
the Firm does business.
Financial holding company:
Consolidated supervision. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a bank
holding company (“BHC”) and a financial holding company
(“FHC”) under U.S. federal law, and is subject to
comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and
examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Federal
Reserve acts as the supervisor of the consolidated
operations of BHCs. Certain of JPMorgan Chase’s
subsidiaries are also regulated directly by additional
authorities based on the activities or licenses of those
subsidiaries.
JPMorgan Chase’s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and, with
respect to certain matters, by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the “FDIC”).
JPMorgan Chase’s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised and
regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(“FINRA”). Subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in certain
futures-related and swaps-related activities are supervised
and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (“CFTC”). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a U.K.-
based bank regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation
Authority (the “PRA”) and the U.K. Financial Conduct
Authority (“FCA”).
JPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution regulated by
the European Central Bank (“ECB”) as well as the local
regulators in each of the countries in which it operates. The
Firm’s other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the
banking, securities, prudential and conduct regulatory
authorities, as applicable, in the countries in which they
operate.
Permissible business activities. The Bank Holding Company
Act restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other
than the business of banking and certain closely-related
activities. FHCs are permitted to engage in a broader range
of financial activities. The Federal Reserve has the authority
to limit an FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible
activities if the FHC or any of its depository institution
subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility
requirements. The Federal Reserve may also impose
corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the
FHC, and if deficiencies are persistent, may require
divestiture of the FHC’s depository institutions. If any
depository institution controlled by an FHC fails to maintain
a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment
Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit the FHC and its
subsidiaries from engaging in any new activities other than
those permissible for BHCs, or acquiring a company
engaged in such activities.
Capital and liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve
establishes capital, liquidity and leverage requirements for
JPMorgan Chase that are generally consistent with the
international Basel III capital and liquidity framework and
evaluates the Firm’s compliance with those requirements.
The OCC establishes similar requirements for JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries
and branches are also subject to local capital and liquidity
requirements.
Banking supervisors globally continue to refine and
enhance the Basel III capital framework for financial
institutions. U.S. banking regulators have announced their
support for the issuance of the Basel III reforms and are
considering how to appropriately apply such reforms in the
U.S.
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104.
Stress tests. As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is subject to
supervisory stress testing administered by the Federal
Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve’s annual
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”)
framework. The Firm must conduct annual company-run
stress tests and must also submit an annual capital plan to
the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of
separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal
Reserve. The Federal Reserve uses the results under the
severely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to
determine the Firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”)
requirement for the coming year, which forms part of the
Firm’s applicable capital buffers. The Firm is required to file
its annual CCAR submission on April 5, 2023. The Federal
Reserve will notify the Firm of its indicative SCB
requirement by June 30, 2023 and final SCB requirement
by August 31, 2023. The Firm’s final SCB requirement will
become effective on October 1, 2023. The OCC requires
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar
stress tests annually. The Firm publishes each year the
results of the annual stress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. under the supervisory “severely adverse”
scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC.
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for more
information concerning the Firm’s CCAR.
Enhanced prudential standards. As part of its mandate to
identify and monitor risks to the financial stability of the
U.S. posed by large banking organizations, the Financial
Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) recommends
prudential standards and reporting requirements to the
Federal Reserve for systemically important financial
institutions (“SIFIs”), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal
Reserve has adopted several rules to implement those
heightened prudential standards, including rules relating to
risk management and corporate governance of subject
BHCs. JPMorgan Chase is required under these rules to
comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk
Part I
4
management standards, including oversight by the board of
directors of risk management activities.
Resolution and recovery. The Firm is required to maintain a
comprehensive recovery plan, updated annually,
summarizing the actions it would take to remain wellcapitalized and well-funded in order to avoid failure in the
case of an adverse event. In addition, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. is required to prepare and submit a recovery
plan as directed by the OCC. The Firm is required to submit
periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for
resolution in the event of material distress or failure (a
“resolution plan”). In 2019, the FDIC and Federal Reserve
revised the regulations governing resolution plan
requirements, and on the basis of those revisions, the
Firm’s resolution plan submissions will alternate between
“targeted” and “full” plans. The Firm’s “targeted” resolution
plan was filed on June 28, 2021, and the Firm's next "full"
resolution plan is due to be filed on or before July 1, 2023.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also required to prepare and
submit a separate resolution plan as directed by the FDIC
on or before December 1, 2023.
Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are
also subject to local resolution and recovery planning
requirements.
Orderly liquidation authority. Certain financial companies,
including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its subsidiaries,
can also be subjected to resolution under an “orderly
liquidation authority.” The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in
consultation with the President of the United States, must
first make certain determinations concerning extraordinary
financial distress and systemic risk, and action must be
recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent
such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject to
resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC has issued
a draft policy statement describing its “single point of
entry” strategy for resolution of SIFIs under the orderly
liquidation authority, which seeks to keep operating
subsidiaries of a BHC open and impose losses on
shareholders and creditors of the BHC in receivership
according to their statutory order of priority.
Holding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan Chase &
Co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for
its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit
resources to support those subsidiaries, including when
directed to do so by the Federal Reserve.
Regulation of acquisitions. Acquisitions by BHCs and their
banks are subject to requirements, limitations and
prohibitions established by law and by the Federal Reserve
and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are required to
obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they
acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an
unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by financial
companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition,
the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed
10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies.
Furthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must
provide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to
acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any
voting shares of any company with over $10 billion in
assets that is engaged in activities that are “financial in
nature.” Moreover, while FHCs may engage in a broader
range of activities (including acquisitions) than BHCs, the
Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHC’s ability to
conduct otherwise permissible acquisitions if the FHC or any
of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet
applicable eligibility requirements.
Ongoing obligations. The Firm is subject to obligations
under the terms of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
entered into with the Department of Justice on September
29, 2020 relating to precious metals and U.S. Treasuries
markets investigations as well as under a related order
issued by the CFTC.
Subsidiary banks:
The activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Firm’s
principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those specifically
authorized under the National Bank Act and related
interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has authority to bring
an enforcement action against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
for unsafe or unsound banking practices, which could
include limiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s ability to
conduct otherwise permissible activities, or imposing
corrective capital or managerial requirements on the bank.
FDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance fund
provides insurance coverage for certain deposits and is
funded through assessments on banks, including JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.
FDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon any insolvency of
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC could be appointed as
conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad powers to transfer assets
and liabilities without the approval of the institution’s
creditors.
Prompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant
federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective
action” with respect to a depository institution if that
institution does not meet certain capital adequacy
standards. The Federal Reserve is also authorized to take
appropriate action against the parent BHC, such as
JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the undercapitalized status
of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would
be required to guarantee the performance of the capital
restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.
OCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has established
guidelines setting forth heightened standards for large
banks, including minimum standards for the design and
implementation of a risk governance framework for banks.
Under these standards, a bank’s risk governance framework
must ensure that the bank’s risk profile is easily
distinguished and separate from that of its parent BHC for
risk management purposes. The bank’s board or risk
5
committee is responsible for approving the bank’s risk
governance framework, providing active oversight of the
bank’s risk-taking activities, and holding management
accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework.
Restrictions on transactions with affiliates. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to restrictions
imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to,
investments in stock or securities of, and derivatives,
securities lending and certain other transactions with,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain other affiliates. These
restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other
affiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries unless the
loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with
certain other requirements.
Dividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations on the
payment of dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the amount of
dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could pay, at
January 1, 2023, to JPMorgan Chase without the approval
of the banking regulators. The OCC and the Federal Reserve
also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of
dividends of a bank subsidiary that they supervise if, in the
banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would
constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the
financial condition of the bank.
Depositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of a
receiver of an insured depositary institution (“IDI”) for
administrative expense and the claims of holders of U.S.
deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and deposits in nonU.S. branches that are dually payable in the U.S. and in a
non-U.S. branch) have priority over the claims of other
unsecured creditors of the institution, including depositors
in non-U.S. branches and public noteholders.
Consumer supervision and regulation. JPMorgan Chase and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to supervision and
regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(“CFPB”) with respect to federal consumer protection laws,
including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of
unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection
with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial
products and services. The CFPB also has jurisdiction over
small business lending activities with respect to fair lending
and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As part of its
regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take
enforcement actions against firms that offer certain
products and services to consumers using practices that are
deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. In February
2023, the CFPB proposed a rule that would significantly
reduce and limit the late payment fees that credit card
issuers, including the Firm, would be permitted to charge to
customers. The Firm’s consumer activities are also subject
to regulation under state statutes which are enforced by the
Attorney General or empowered agency of each state.
In the U.K., the Firm operates a retail bank through J.P.
Morgan Europe Limited (“JPMEL”) and provides retail
investment management services through Nutmeg Saving
and Investment Limited (“Nutmeg”). JPMEL is regulated by
the PRA, and both JPMEL and Nutmeg are regulated by the
FCA with respect to their conduct of financial services in the
U.K., including obligations relating to the fair treatment of
customers. JPMEL is also regulated by the U.K. Payment
Systems Regulator with respect to its operation and use of
payment systems. In addition, the retail businesses of
JPMEL and Nutmeg are subject to U.K. consumer-protection
legislation.
Securities and broker-dealer regulation:
The Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and
brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer
subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the
SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange, among
others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities
outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory requirements. In
the U.K., those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan
Securities plc. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and
regulations covering all aspects of the securities business,
including sales and trading practices, securities offerings,
publication of research reports, use of customer funds, the
financing of client purchases, capital structure, recordkeeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors,
officers and employees. Refer to Broker-dealer regulatory
capital on page 96 for information concerning the capital of
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc.
Investment management regulation:
The Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses are
subject to significant regulation in jurisdictions around the
world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding and
management of client assets, offerings of funds and
marketing activities. Certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries are
registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as
investment advisers and broker-dealers. The Firm’s
registered investment advisers in the United States are
subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and applicable
state and federal law. The Firm’s bank fiduciary activities
are subject to supervision by the OCC.
Derivatives regulation:
The Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its
derivatives businesses, including regulations that impose
capital and margin requirements, require central clearing of
standardized over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives,
mandate that certain standardized OTC swaps be traded on
regulated trading venues, and provide for reporting of
certain mandated information. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc
are registered with the CFTC as “swap dealers”. In addition,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
are registered with the SEC as “security-based swap
dealers”. As a result, these entities are subject to a
comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to their
swap or security-based swap activities, including capital
requirements, rules requiring the collateralization of
uncleared swaps and security-based swaps, rules regarding
Part I
6
segregation of counterparty collateral, business conduct
and documentation standards, record-keeping and
reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation
requirements. Similar requirements have also been
established under the European Market Infrastructure
Regulation (“EMIR”) and the Markets in Financial
Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”), as implemented in the
EU and as adopted in the U.K.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is also registered with the CFTC
as a futures commission merchant and is a member of the
National Futures Association.
Data, privacy and cybersecurity regulation:
The Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to laws, rules and
regulations globally concerning data, including data
protection, consumer protection, privacy, cybersecurity and
related matters. These laws, rules and regulations are
constantly evolving, subject to interpretation, remain a
focus of regulators globally, may be enforced by private
parties or government bodies, and will continue to have a
significant impact on all of the Firm’s businesses and
operations.
The Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions:
The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial
institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers,
to establish a risk-based system of internal controls
reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the
financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements, as well as due
diligence/know-your-customer documentation
requirements. The Firm is also subject to the regulations
and economic sanctions programs administered and
enforced by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets
Control (“OFAC”) and EU and U.K. authorities which target
entities or individuals that are, or are located in countries
that are, involved in activities including terrorism,
hostilities, embezzlement or human rights violations. The
Firm is also subject to economic sanctions laws, rules and
regulations in other jurisdictions in which it operates,
including those that conflict with or prohibit a firm such as
JPMorgan Chase from complying with certain laws, rules
and regulations to which it is otherwise subject.
Anti-Corruption:
The Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to
corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and
others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.
Compensation practices:
The Firm’s compensation practices are subject to oversight
by the Federal Reserve, as well as other agencies. The
Federal Reserve has jointly issued guidance with the FDIC
and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive
compensation paid by banking organizations does not
encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the
organizations’ safety and soundness. The Financial Stability
Board (“FSB”) has also established standards covering
compensation principles for banks. The Firm’s
compensation practices are also subject to regulation and
oversight by regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the
Fifth Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD V”), as
implemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K, which
includes compensation-related provisions. The European
Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on
compensation policies including under CRD V which in
certain countries, such as Germany, are implemented or
supplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The U.K.
regulators have also instituted guidelines on CRD V
compensation policies. The Firm expects that the
implementation of regulatory guidelines regarding
compensation in the U.S. and other countries will continue
to evolve, and may affect the manner in which the Firm
structures its compensation programs and practices.
Other significant international regulatory initiatives:
Policymakers in the U.K. and EU continue to implement a
program of regulatory enhancements relating to financial
services, several key elements of which are discussed
below.
MiFID II requires the trading of shares and certain
standardized OTC derivatives to take place on specified
trading venues. MiFID II also significantly enhanced
requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency,
transaction reporting and investor protection, and
introduced a position limits and reporting regime for
commodities. In November 2021, the European Commission
(“EC”) published a draft legislative proposal for
amendments to MiFID II focused on changes to rules related
to transparency and market structure, including the
proposed creation of a consolidated tape intended to
increase transparency into trading across the EU by
providing a centralized source of market data. This
legislation remains subject to review by the European
Parliament and European Council.
In the U.K., MiFID II is being amended through the
“Wholesale Markets Review”, a set of proposals designed to
streamline and improve regulation of the U.K. secondary
markets following the U.K.’s departure from the EU. Some
of the changes, such as the removal of the requirement to
execute trades in shares on certain trading venues, have
been introduced through the Financial Services and Markets
Bill (“FSMB”), which is expected to be passed by the U.K.
Parliament in the first half of 2023. Other changes, such as
amendments to MiFID II rules related to transparency, will
be subject to further consultation, which is expected during
2023.
7
In December 2022, the EC published a legislative proposal
to amend EMIR to increase the competitiveness of the EU
central clearing framework and to enhance supervision of
EU central counterparties (“CCPs”). These proposals are
subject to further review by the European Parliament and
European Council.
The EU has adopted mandatory buy-in rules under the
Central Securities Depositories Regulation (“CSDR”) which
will impose requirements relating to sourcing of securities
in the event of a settlement fail. In June 2022, EU
regulators proposed an amendment to postpone the
application of these rules until November 2025. The
amendment remains subject to review by the European
Parliament and European Council.
In December 2022, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
announced an extensive package of reforms to U.K.
financial services regulation known as the “Edinburgh
Reforms”. These reforms aim to drive growth and
competitiveness in the U.K. financial services sector
following the U.K.’s departure from the EU. The reform
package includes initiatives relating to a number of areas of
financial services policy, including retail banks, payments,
markets, digital assets and sustainable finance. The U.K.
Government and regulators are expected to release further
consultations and announcements related to these reforms
in 2023.
EU and U.K. regulators are expected to finalize the rules
implementing the Basel III framework during 2023. The
Firm’s banking entities in the EU and the U.K. will be
required to comply with the Basel III final rules by January
2025, allowing for certain transitional arrangements until
2030 and 2032, respectively. The main changes
implemented by the Basel III final rules will be revisions to
the credit risk and operational risk calculation methods to
reduce the use of and reliance on internal modelling
approaches and introduce internationally-agreed changes
to the market risk framework. The EU Basel III final rules
also strengthen enforcement tools for supervisors
overseeing EU banks and require EU banking entities to
systematically identify, disclose and manage environmental,
social and governance (“ESG”) risks as part of their risk
management practices. In addition, in December 2022, the
European Banking Authority (“EBA”) announced that it will
publish rules and technical standards between 2023 and
2025 related to sustainable finance, which will be
applicable to EU banks. The Firm’s banking entities in the
U.K. will be required to comply with regulatory policies and
standards related to climate risk being developed by the
PRA. In addition, EU legislation requires that certain non-EU
banks operating in the EU establish an intermediate parent
undertaking (“IPU”) located in the EU. The IPU legislation
allows a second IPU to be established if a single IPU would
conflict with “home country” bank separation rules or
impede resolvability. The Firm will be required to comply
with the EU’s IPU requirements by December 30, 2023.
The Firm’s banking entities in the EU and U.K. are also
subject to supervisory expectations published by the ECB
and the PRA, respectively, for management of financial
risks arising from climate change and the increasing
operational reliance on IT systems, third-party services and
innovative technologies, as well as supervisory expectations
for operational resilience and resilience from macrofinancial and geopolitical shocks. These expectations
address bank strategy, governance, risk management,
scenario analysis, risk reporting and disclosure.
Policymakers in the EU have continued to implement
sustainability-related initiatives. In December 2022, the
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) was
published in the Official Journal of the EU. The CSRD will
replace and significantly expand the scope and content of
ESG reporting requirements under the EU’s existing ESG
reporting rules. CSRD reporting requirements will be
phased in beginning in 2024. In addition, the EC published
its legislative proposal on the Corporate Sustainability Due
Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”) in February 2022. The draft
directive sets mandatory due diligence obligations for
companies to address actual and potential human rights
violations and environmental adverse impacts stemming
from their own operations and business relationships,
including the activities of companies with which they have
established business relationships. The proposed legislation
may also require the adoption of company-specific climaterelated transition plans. The CSDDD is currently subject to
review by the European Parliament and European Council.
Both the CSRD and CSDDD will apply to certain of the Firm’s
EU entities as well as to certain non-EU entities.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors
that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and
operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of
these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that
could affect the Firm. Any of the risk factors discussed below
could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and
adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of
operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity,
competitive position or reputation, including by materially
increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, which could
result in material losses or a decrease in earnings.
Summary
The principal risk factors that could adversely affect
JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations, financial
condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or
reputation include:
• Regulatory risks, including the impact that applicable
laws, rules and regulations in the highly-regulated and
supervised financial services industry, as well as
changes to or in the application, interpretation or
enforcement of those laws, rules and regulations, can
have on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations; the
ways in which differences in financial services
regulation in different jurisdictions or with respect to
certain competitors can negatively impact JPMorgan
Chase’s business; the penalties and collateral
consequences, and higher compliance and operational
costs, that JPMorgan Chase may incur when resolving a
regulatory investigation; the ways in which less
predictable legal and regulatory frameworks in certain
countries can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s
operations and financial results; and the losses that
security holders will absorb if JPMorgan Chase were to
enter into a resolution.
• Political risks, including the potential negative effects
on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses due to economic
uncertainty or instability caused by political
developments.
• Market risks, including the effects that economic and
market events and conditions, governmental policies,
changes in interest rates and credit spreads, and
market fluctuations can have on JPMorgan Chase’s
consumer and wholesale businesses and its investment
and market-making positions and on JPMorgan Chase’s
earnings and its liquidity and capital levels.
• Credit risks, including potential negative effects from
adverse changes in the financial condition of clients,
customers, counterparties, custodians and central
counterparties; and the potential for losses due to
declines in the value of collateral in stressed market
conditions or from concentrations of credit and market
risk.
• Liquidity risks, including the risk that JPMorgan
Chase’s liquidity could be impaired by market-wide
illiquidity or disruption, unforeseen liquidity or capital
requirements, the inability to sell assets, default by a
significant market participant, unanticipated outflows
of cash or collateral, or lack of market or customer
confidence in JPMorgan Chase; the dependence of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. on the cash flows of its
subsidiaries; the adverse effects that any downgrade in
any of JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may have on its
liquidity and cost of funding; and potential negative
impacts, including litigation risks, associated with the
transition to alternative reference rates.
• Capital risks, including the risk that any failure by or
inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required
level and composition of capital, or unfavorable
changes in applicable capital requirements, could limit
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to distribute capital to
shareholders or to support its business activities.
• Operational risks, including risks associated with
JPMorgan Chase’s dependence on its operational
systems, its ability to maintain appropriately-staffed
workforces and the competence, integrity, health and
safety of its employees, as well as the systems and
employees of third parties, market participants and
service providers; the potential negative effects of
failing to identify and address operational risks related
to the introduction of or changes to products, services
and delivery platforms; legal and regulatory risks
related to safeguarding personal information; the harm
that could be caused by a successful cyber attack
affecting JPMorgan Chase or by other extraordinary
events; risks associated with JPMorgan Chase’s risk
management framework, its models and estimations
and associated judgments used in its stress testing and
financial statements, and controls over disclosure and
financial reporting; and potential adverse effects of
failing to comply with heightened regulatory and other
standards for the oversight of vendors and other
service providers.
• Strategic risks, including the damage to JPMorgan
Chase’s competitive standing and results that could
occur if management fails to develop and execute
effective business strategies; risks associated with the
significant and increasing competition that JPMorgan
Chase faces; and the potential adverse impacts of
climate change on JPMorgan Chase’s business
operations, clients and customers.
• Conduct risks, including the negative impact that can
result from the actions or misconduct of employees,
including any failure of employees to conduct
themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s
expectations, policies and practices.
• Reputation risks, including the potential adverse
effects on JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with its
clients, customers, shareholders, regulators and other
stakeholders that could arise from employee
misconduct, security breaches, inadequate risk
9
management, compliance or operational failures,
litigation and regulatory investigations, failure to
satisfy expectations concerning environmental, social
and governance concerns, failure to effectively manage
conflicts of interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations,
or other factors that could damage JPMorgan Chase’s
reputation.
• Country risks, including potential impacts on JPMorgan
Chase’s businesses from an outbreak or escalation of
hostilities between countries or within a country or
region; and the potential adverse effects of local
economic, political, regulatory and social factors on
JPMorgan Chase’s business and revenues in certain
countries.
• People risks, including the criticality of attracting and
retaining qualified and diverse employees; and the
potential adverse effects of unfavorable changes in
immigration or travel policies on JPMorgan Chase’s
workforce.
• Legal risks, including those relating to litigation and
regulatory and government investigations.
The above summary is subject in its entirety to the
discussion of the risk factors set forth below.
Regulatory
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and
the laws, rules and regulations that apply to JPMorgan
Chase have a significant impact on its business and
operations.
JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations
worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws,
rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of
the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business,
and financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase are
subject to extensive regulation and supervision.
The regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase
significantly affects the way that it conducts its business
and structures its operations, and JPMorgan Chase could be
required to make changes to its business and operations in
response to supervisory expectations or decisions or to new
or changed laws, rules and regulations. These types of
developments could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring
additional costs in connection with complying with
applicable laws, rules and regulations, which could reduce
its profitability. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase’s entry into
or acquisition of a new business or an increase in its
principal investments may require JPMorgan Chase to
comply with additional laws, rules, and regulations.
In response to new and existing laws, rules and regulations
and expanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the past
been and could in the future be, required to:
• limit the products and services that it offers
• reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its
market-making activities
• refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it
might otherwise pursue
• pay higher taxes (including as part of any minimum
global tax regime), assessments, levies or other
governmental charges, including in connection with the
resolution of tax examinations
• incur losses, including with respect to fraudulent
transactions perpetrated against its customers
• dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices
that are disadvantageous
• impose restrictions on certain business activities, or
• increase the prices that it charges for products and
services, which could reduce the demand for them.
Any failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with the laws,
rules and regulations to which it is subject could result in:
• increased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny
• regulatory and governmental enforcement actions
• the imposition of fines, penalties or other sanctions
• increased exposure to litigation, or
• harm to its reputation.
Differences and inconsistencies in financial services
regulation can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s
businesses, operations and financial results.
The content and application of laws, rules and regulations
affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according
to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in
which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For
example:
• larger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often subject
to more stringent supervision, regulation and
regulatory scrutiny
• financial technology companies and other nontraditional competitors may not be subject to banking
regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state
regulatory agency that does not have the same
resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory
agencies which supervise more diversified financial
services firms, or
• the financial services regulatory framework in a
particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions
that are based in that jurisdiction.
These types of differences in the regulatory framework can
result in JPMorgan Chase losing market share to
competitors that are less regulated or not subject to
regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial
products.
There can also be significant differences in the ways that
similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services
industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries
and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For
Part I
10
example, when adopting rules that are intended to
implement a global regulatory standard, a national
regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive
requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages
for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that
may be subject to those enhanced regulations.
In addition, certain national and multi-national bodies and
governmental agencies outside the U.S. have adopted laws,
rules or regulations that may conflict with or prohibit
JPMorgan Chase from complying with laws, rules and
regulations to which it is otherwise subject, creating conflict
of law issues that also increase its risks of non-compliance
in those jurisdictions.
Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could
require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications
to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant
countries or regions in order to comply with those
requirements. These include laws, rules and regulations
that have been adopted or proposed relating to:
• the establishment of locally-based intermediate holding
companies or operating subsidiaries
• requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital
or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries
• to implement processes within locally-based
subsidiaries to comply with local regulatory
requirements
• the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking
products and services from markets activities
• the resolution of financial institutions
• requirements for executing or settling transactions on
exchanges or through central counterparties (“CCPs”)
• position limits and reporting rules for derivatives
• governance and accountability regimes
• conduct of business and control requirements, and
• restrictions on compensation.
These types of differences, inconsistencies and conflicts in
financial services regulation have required and could in the
future require JPMorgan Chase to:
• divest assets or restructure its operations
• absorb increased capital and liquidity costs
• incur higher operational and compliance costs
• change the prices that it charges for its products and
services
• curtail the products and services that it offers to its
customers and clients
• curtail other business opportunities, including
acquisitions or principal investments, that it otherwise
would have pursued
• become subject to regulatory fines, penalties or other
sanctions, or
• incur higher costs for complying with different legal
and regulatory frameworks.
Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase’s
ability to compete against other firms that are not subject
to the same laws, rules and regulations or supervisory
oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of
operations and profitability.
Resolving regulatory investigations can subject JPMorgan
Chase to significant penalties and collateral
consequences, and could result in higher compliance
costs or restrictions on its operations.
JPMorgan Chase is subject to heightened oversight and
scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions.
JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, provided other
monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced
other repercussions in connection with resolving
investigations and enforcement actions by governmental
agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar
regulatory or governmental resolutions or other actions in
the future, and addressing the requirements of any such
resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase
incurring higher operational and compliance costs,
including devoting substantial resources to the required
remediation, or needing to comply with other restrictions.
In connection with resolving specific regulatory
investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators
have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial
institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the
activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of
admissions can lead to:
• greater exposure in litigation
• damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation
• disqualification from doing business with certain clients
or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or
• other direct and indirect adverse effects.
Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated
a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial
institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty
to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in
connection with resolving regulatory investigations or
enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have
significant collateral consequences for the subject financial
institution, including:
• loss of clients, customers and business
• restrictions on offering certain products or services,
and
• losing permission to operate certain businesses, either
temporarily or permanently.
JPMorgan Chase expects that:
11
• it and other financial services firms will continue to be
subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and
governmental investigations and enforcement actions
• governmental authorities will continue to require that
financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed
violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement
actions, including the imposition of significant
monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving
these matters through informal supervisory actions;
and
• governmental authorities will be more likely to pursue
formal enforcement actions and resolutions against
JPMorgan Chase to the extent that it has previously
been subject to other governmental investigations or
enforcement actions.
If JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any
resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement
action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet
the heightened standards and expectations of its regulators,
it could be required to, among other things:
• enter into further resolutions of investigations or
enforcement actions
• pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into
judgments, or
• accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes
in the management of, its businesses.
In these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become
subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil
litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an
investigation or enforcement action.
JPMorgan Chase’s operations and financial results can be
negatively impacted in countries with less predictable
legal and regulatory frameworks.
JPMorgan Chase conducts existing and new business in
certain countries in which the application of the rule of law
is inconsistent or less predictable, including with respect to:
• the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or
guidance for engaging in specific types of business or
transactions
• conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and regulations, or
the inconsistent application or interpretation of
existing laws, rules and regulations
• uncertainty concerning the enforceability of
contractual, intellectual property or other obligations
• difficulty in competing in economies in which the
government controls or protects all or a portion of the
local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or
corruption may be pervasive
• the threat of regulatory investigations, civil litigations
or criminal prosecutions that are arbitrary or otherwise
contrary to established legal principles in other parts of
the world, and
• the termination of licenses required to operate in the
local market or the suspension of business
relationships with governmental bodies.
If the application of the laws, rules and regulations in any
country is susceptible to producing inconsistent or
unexpected outcomes, this can create a more difficult
environment in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its business
and could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations
and reduce its earnings with respect to that country. For
example, conducting business could require JPMorgan
Chase to devote significant additional resources to
understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws, rules
and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to
comply with local laws, rules and regulations and
implementing and administering related internal policies
and procedures.
There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always
be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to
conduct its business in compliance with the laws, rules and
regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates,
and the risk of non-compliance can be greater in countries
that have less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.
Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan
Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to
restructure or reorganize its businesses and could
increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its
businesses.
JPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and
FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those
agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in
bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in
the event of material financial distress or failure. The
agencies’ evaluation of JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan
may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may
be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or
modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to
make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain
internal or external activities, which could increase its
funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to serve
clients and customers.
If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to determine
that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has
deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent
capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on
JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities or operations. The
agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase
restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in
ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan
Chase’s operations and strategy.
Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity
securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a
resolution.
Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co.
(the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of
unsecured external long-term debt and other lossPart I
12
absorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) for
purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s operating
subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a
resolution either:
• in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or
• in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II
of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).
If the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution,
holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities
of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent
Company and its subsidiaries.
The preferred “single point of entry” strategy under
JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only
the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy
proceedings. JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be
recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue
normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound
down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent
Company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries
would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company’s
equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors,
including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities.
Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior
position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s
subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by
statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.
Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in
bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt
securities of the Parent Company would realize value only
to the extent available to the Parent Company as a
shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other
subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and
secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully
repaid.
The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry
recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to
resolve a systemically important financial institution, such
as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC
has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution
strategy.
If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a
resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal
Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase’s
preferred resolution strategy, and losses to holders of
eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the
Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately
followed, could be greater than they might have been under
JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy.
Political
Economic uncertainty or instability caused by political
developments can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s
businesses.
Political developments in the U.S. and other countries can
cause uncertainty in the economic environment and market
conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates its
businesses. Certain governmental policy initiatives, as well
as heightened geopolitical tensions, could significantly
affect U.S. and global economic growth and cause higher
volatility in the financial markets, including:
• monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal
Reserve and other central banks or governmental
authorities, including any sustained large-scale asset
purchases or any suspension or reversal of those
actions
• fiscal policies, including with respect to taxation and
spending
• actions that governments take or fail to take in
response to the effects of health emergencies, the
spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics,
as well as the effectiveness of any actions taken
• governmental actions or initiatives relating to climate
risk, or more generally, the impact of business
activities on environmental, social and governance
(“ESG”) matters, and the management of climate and
ESG-related risks
• isolationist foreign policies
• an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other
geopolitical instabilities
• economic or financial sanctions
• the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist
trade policies, or
• other governmental policies or actions adopted or
taken in response to political or social pressures.
These types of political developments, and uncertainty
about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:
• erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and
financial markets, which could potentially undermine
the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency
• provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other
countries and otherwise heighten tensions in
regulatory, enforcement or diplomatic relations
• lead to the withdrawal of government support for
agencies and enterprises such as the U.S. Federal
National Mortgage Association and the U.S. Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the “U.S.
GSEs”)
• increase concerns about whether the U.S. government
will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at
any particular time
13
• result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or
governments in other countries
• increase investor reliance on actions by the Federal
Reserve or other central banks, or influence investor
perceptions concerning government support of sectors
of the economy or the economy as a whole
• adversely affect the financial condition or credit ratings
of clients and counterparties with which JPMorgan
Chase does business, or
• cause JPMorgan Chase to refrain from engaging in
business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue.
These factors could lead to:
• slower growth rates, rising inflation or recession
• greater market volatility
• a contraction of available credit and the widening of
credit spreads
• erosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial
assets
• diminished investor and consumer confidence
• lower investment growth
• large-scale sales of government debt and other debt
and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries
• reduced commercial activity among trading partners
• the potential for a currency redenomination by a
particular country
• the possible departure of a country from, or the
dissolution of, a political or economic alliance or treaty
• potential expropriation or nationalization of assets, or
• other market dislocations, including the spread of
unfavorable economic conditions from a particular
country or region to other countries or regions.
Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan
Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in
its investment portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital
levels, increase the allowance for credit losses or lead to
higher net charge offs, hamper its ability to deliver products
and services to its clients and customers, and weaken its
results of operations and financial condition.
JPMorgan Chase's business and results of operations may
also be adversely affected by actions or initiatives by
national, state or local governmental authorities that:
• seek to discourage financial institutions from doing
business with companies engaged in certain industries,
or conversely, to penalize financial institutions that
elect not to do business with such companies, or
• mandate specific business practices that companies
operating in the relevant jurisdiction must adopt.
Because governmental policies in one jurisdiction may differ
or conflict with those in other jurisdictions, JPMorgan Chase
may face negative consequences regardless of the course of
action it takes or elects not to take, including:
• restrictions or prohibitions on doing business within a
particular jurisdiction, or with governmental entities in
a jurisdiction
• the threat of enforcement actions, including under
antitrust or other anti-competition laws, rules and
regulations, and
• harm to its reputation arising from public criticism,
including from politicians, activists and other
stakeholders.
In addition, JPMorgan Chase's relationships or ability to
transact with clients and customers, and with governmental
or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan
Chase does business, could be adversely affected if its
decisions with respect to doing business with companies in
certain sensitive industries are perceived to harm those
companies or to align with particular political viewpoints.
Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase's participation in or
association with certain social and environmental industry
groups or initiatives could be viewed by activists or
governmental authorities as boycotting or other
discriminatory business behavior.
Market
Economic and market events and conditions can
materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and
investment and market-making positions.
JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be negatively
affected by adverse changes in any of the following:
• investor, consumer and business sentiment
• events that reduce confidence in the financial markets
• inflation, deflation or recession
• high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor
market
• the availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit
• levels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and
market prices for currencies, equities and commodities,
and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility
• the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of
hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities,
cyber attacks, climate change, natural disasters, severe
weather conditions, health emergencies, the spread of
infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics or other
extraordinary events beyond JPMorgan Chase’s control,
and
• the strength of the U.S. and global economies.
All of these are affected by global economic, market and
political events and conditions, as well as regulatory
restrictions.
Part I
14
In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s investment portfolio and
market-making businesses can suffer losses due to
unanticipated market events, including:
• severe declines in asset values
• unexpected credit events
• unforeseen events or conditions that may cause
previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated
(and vice versa)
• the inability to effectively hedge market and other risks
related to market-making and investment portfolio
positions, or
• other market risks that may not have been
appropriately taken into account in the development,
structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.
If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its
investment portfolio or from market-making activities, this
could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability and its liquidity
and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its
businesses.
JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively
affected by adverse economic conditions and
governmental policies.
JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly
affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:
• personal and household income distribution
• unemployment or underemployment
• prolonged periods of exceptionally low or high interest
rates
• housing prices
• the level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods
and services
• consumer and small business confidence levels, and
• changes in consumer spending or in the level of
consumer debt.
Heightened levels of unemployment or underemployment
that result in reduced personal and household income could
negatively affect consumer credit performance to the
extent that consumers are less able to service their debts.
In addition, sustained low growth, low or negative interest
rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions
could diminish customer demand for the products and
services offered by JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses.
Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase
in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses
and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan
Chase’s earnings. These consequences could be significantly
worse in certain geographies and industry segments where
declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted
in or could result in higher levels of unemployment, or
where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding
student loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay
their other consumer loan obligations.
JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses
could also be adversely affected by governmental policies
and actions that affect consumers, including:
• policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance,
education, immigration, employment status and
housing, and
• policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as
higher taxes and increased regulation which could
result in reductions in consumer disposable income.
Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an
adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale
businesses.
In JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and
economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that
JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it
advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan
Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can
also influence the willingness of other financial institutions
and investors to participate in capital markets transactions
that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or
securities underwriting. Furthermore, if a significant and
sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur,
the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s capital markets
businesses, including its loan syndication, securities
underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could be
reduced to the extent that those businesses:
• earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction
volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable
to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in
unfavorable market conditions, or
• dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or
hold larger residual positions in credit commitments
that cannot be sold at favorable prices.
An adverse change in market conditions in particular
segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe
downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity
prices, or sustained changes in consumer behavior that
affect specific economic sectors, could have a material
adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose
operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly
dependent on the health or stability of those market
segments or economic sectors, as well as clients that are
engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur
credit losses on its loans and other credit commitments to
clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of
the economy that is under stress.
The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client
assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be
diminished by declining asset values or other adverse
macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest
rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the
valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or
15
holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan
Chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of
assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse
macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt
outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause
clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue.
Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan
Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of
the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the
fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or
prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the
weaker investment performance.
An economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer
behavior that results in shifts in consumer and business
spending could also have a negative impact on certain of
JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and thereby diminish
JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations.
For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase’s
wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of
rental income from commercial real estate properties which
are owned or being built by those clients. Sustained adverse
economic conditions could result in reductions in the rental
cash flows that owners or developers receive from their
tenants which, in turn, could depress the values of the
properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or
refinance their commercial real estate loans. These
consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing
increases in the allowance for credit losses, higher
delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its
commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher
costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in
that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s earnings
from its wholesale businesses.
Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can
adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s earnings, its liquidity
or its capital levels.
When interest rates are high or increasing, JPMorgan Chase
can generally be expected to earn higher net interest
income. However, higher interest rates can also lead to:
• fewer originations of commercial and residential real
estate loans
• losses on underwriting exposures or incremental clientspecific downgrades, or increases in the allowance for
credit losses and net charge-offs due to higher
financing costs for clients
• the loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw
deposits because they believe that interest rates
offered by JPMorgan Chase are lower than those of
competitors or if JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect
assumptions about depositor behavior
• losses on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities held in
the investment securities portfolio
• lower net interest income if central banks introduce
interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated
and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of
short-term and long-term borrowings
• less liquidity in the financial markets, and
• higher funding costs.
All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan
Chase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels. Higher
interest rates can also negatively affect the payment
performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer
and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable
interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable
to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may
reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing
JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational
costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent
loans.
On the other hand, a low or negative interest rate
environment may cause:
• net interest margins to be compressed, which could
reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its
investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is
unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higheryielding instruments
• unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor
behavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan
Chase’s broader asset and liability management
strategy, and
• a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s mortgage
servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby decreasing
revenues.
When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for
JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit
spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events
and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but
also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events
and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads
will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s
earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are
recorded at fair value.
JPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by
market fluctuations and significant changes in the value
of financial instruments.
The value of securities, derivatives and other financial
instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it
makes markets can be materially affected by market
fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions
and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it
extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments.
Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future
periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in
significant changes in the value of these instruments. In
addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial
instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately
realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the
market at that time and may be materially lower than their
Part I
16
current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a
decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorgan
Chase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have
an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of
operations.
JPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring
processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to
quantify and manage JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to more
extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan Chase’s
hedging and other risk management strategies may not be
effective, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme
market events were to occur.
Credit
JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse
changes in the financial condition of clients,
counterparties, custodians and CCPs.
JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with clients
and counterparties such as corporations, financial
institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities
exchanges and government entities within and outside the
U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to
the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can
involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation if a client
or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be
subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that
it has appointed to provide custodial services for client
assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the
failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, or where
clients are unable to access assets held by JPMorgan Chase
as custodian due to governmental actions or other factors.
A default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP
through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would
require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby
increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in
losses. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed to
losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also
a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of
requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a
portion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase can
be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses
incurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial,
settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other
security breaches.
As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is
exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which
it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate
collateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to intra-day
credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash
management, clearing, custodial and other transaction
services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan
Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or
insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become
involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs,
the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be
subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing
events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and
litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to
the extent that any collateral that it has received is
insufficient to cover those losses.
Transactions with government entities, including national,
state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, can
expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit,
operational and reputation risks. Government entities may,
among other things, claim that actions taken by
government officials were beyond the legal authority of
those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a
previous incumbent government. These types of actions
have in the past caused, and could in the future cause,
JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to
conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction.
In addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to resolve disputes and litigation
in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to
make previously agreed-upon payments, which could
subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.
Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives
contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement
procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The
disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase
to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal
costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can
also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage
its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause
harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.
The financial or operational failure of a significant market
participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or
concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market
participant or its ability to fulfill its obligations, can cause
substantial and cascading disruption within the financial
markets, including in circumstances where coordinated
action by multiple other market participants is required to
address the failure or disruption. JPMorgan Chase’s
businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an
event, particularly if it leads to other market participants
incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or
defaulting, and JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant
interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a
significant market participant.
JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of
collateral declines in stressed market conditions.
During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan
Chase’s credit risk may be further increased when:
• JPMorgan Chase fails to realize the fair value of the
collateral it holds
• collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient
to recover the full amount owed to it, or
• counterparties are unable to post collateral, whether
for operational or other reasons.
Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the
valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant
17
market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase
could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to
realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in
the value of collateral.
JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising
from concentrations of credit and market risk.
JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market
risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or
counterparties:
• engage in similar or related businesses, or in
businesses in related industries
• do business in the same geographic region, or
• have business profiles, models or strategies that could
cause their ability to meet their obligations to be
similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.
For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality
of one of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties
could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other
borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or
dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could
exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s credit, liquidity and market
risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses,
including fair value losses in its market-making businesses
and investment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may
be required to increase the allowance for credit losses with
respect to certain clients or industries in order to align with
directives or expectations of its banking regulators.
Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a
particular industry or geographic area could lead to
concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s
borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular
industry or geography but in related or dependent
industries, wherever located. These conditions could also
heighten concerns about the ability of customers of
JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses who live in those
areas or work in those affected industries or related or
dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan
Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various
segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess
the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its
ability to diversify or hedge its exposure against those risks
may be limited.
JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed
by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or
non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain
types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide
reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or
margins of those loans or the making of loans to lesscreditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers
subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak
credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this
could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to
JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other
credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on
consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the
U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses
may earn lower revenues in such an environment.
If JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively
during a market dislocation, this can increase both the
market and credit risks associated with those positions and
the level of risk-weighted-assets (“RWA”) that JPMorgan
Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could
adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s capital position, funding
costs and the profitability of its businesses.
Liquidity
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses could
be impaired if its liquidity is constrained.
JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given
time by factors such as:
• market-wide illiquidity or disruption
• unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including
as a result of changes in laws, rules and regulations
• inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable
times or prices
• default by a CCP or other significant market participant
• unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral
• unexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than
anticipated draws on lending-related commitments,
and
• lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan
Chase or financial institutions in general.
A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be caused by
events over which it has little or no control. For example,
periods of market stress, low investor confidence and
significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding
costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to some
of its traditional sources of liquidity.
JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative
sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of
funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal
Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of
funding could be more expensive or limited in availability.
JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs could also be negatively
affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order
to:
• satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net
stable funding ratio requirements
• address obligations under its resolution plan, or
• satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside
the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in
subsidiaries that are material legal entities.
More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively
manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund
or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries, and thereby
adversely affect its results of operations.

The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC
substantially all the net proceeds received from securities
issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated
debt securities and of preferred and common stock).
The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to
make payments to the holding company is also
limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to regulatory
restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital
adequacy requirements, such as the Supplementary
Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity requirements and
other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments
to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying
dividends or extending credit to the holding company if
certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if
limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s
management or Board of Directors.
As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding
company to make various payments is dependent on its
receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and
dividends and borrowings from the IHC. These limitations
could affect the holding company’s ability to:
• pay interest on its debt securities
• pay dividends on its equity securities
• redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and
• fulfill its other payment obligations.
These arrangements could also result in the holding
company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or
otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a time
earlier than would have been the case absent the existence
of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is
subject.
Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may
adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal
subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating
agencies evaluate general, firm-specific and industryspecific factors when determining credit ratings for a
particular financial institution, including:
• expected future profitability
• risk management practices
• legal expenses
• ratings differentials between bank holding companies
and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries
• regulatory developments
• assumptions about government support, and
• economic and geopolitical developments.
JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the
extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit
ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan
Chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the
future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at
times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase’s
options for responding to events may be more limited and
general investor confidence is low.
A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could curtail
JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and reduce its
profitability in a number of ways, including:
• reducing its access to capital markets
• materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing
securities
• triggering additional collateral or funding
requirements, and
• decreasing the number of investors and counterparties
that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend
to JPMorgan Chase.
Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads
charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn,
adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.
The transition to alternative reference rates could expose
JPMorgan Chase to operational risks or litigation and
other disputes.
Regulators, industry bodies and other market participants
in the U.S. and other countries continue to engage in
initiatives to introduce and encourage the use of alternative
reference rates to replace certain interest rate indices that
are deemed to be “benchmarks”, and certain of these
alternative rates have gained or are gaining acceptance
among market participants. However, there is no assurance
that:
• any of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the
economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek
to replace
• arrangements by market participants to prepare for the
discontinuation of certain benchmarks and the
transition to alternative reference rates will be fully
effective, or
• a particular alternative reference rate will be widely
accepted by market participants, or that market
acceptance of that rate will not be hindered by the
introduction of other reference rates.
19
For example, vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities,
derivatives and other financial instruments are still linked
to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
benchmark, and significant progress has been made by
regulators, industry bodies and market participants to
introduce and implement the Secured Overnight Financing
Rate (“SOFR”) as a replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR.
However, if market participants have not implemented
effective operational and other arrangements to address
the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR to SOFR, this could
result in dislocation in the financial markets, volatility in the
pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and
the suppression of capital markets activities, all of which
could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s results
of operations and on U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked securities,
credit or other instruments which are issued, funded,
serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.
JPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation
and other types of disputes with clients, customers,
counterparties and investors as a consequence of the
transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR and other benchmark
rates to replacement rates, including claims that JPMorgan
Chase has:
• treated clients, customers, counterparties or investors
unfairly, or caused them to experience losses, higher
financing costs or lower returns on investments
• failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the
transition from benchmark rates on the products that
JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and customers,
or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest
• made inappropriate product recommendations to or
investments on behalf of its clients, or sold products
that did not serve their intended purpose, in connection
with the transition from benchmark rates
• engaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the
manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in
connection with the discontinuation of or transition
from benchmark rates, or
• disadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or
investors when interpreting or making determinations
under the terms of agreements or financial
instruments.
These types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to
higher legal expenses and operational costs, require it to
pay significant amounts in connection with resolving
litigation and other disputes, and harm its reputation.
Capital
Maintaining the required level and composition of capital
may impact JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support business
activities, meet evolving regulatory requirements and
distribute capital to shareholders.
JPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital
requirements, including leverage- and risk-based capital
requirements. In addition, as a Globally Systemically
Important Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorgan Chase is required to
hold additional capital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge,
a Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”), and a countercyclical buffer,
each of which is reassessed at least annually. The amount of
capital that JPMorgan Chase is required to hold in order to
satisfy these leverage-and risk-based requirements could
increase at any given time due to factors such as:
• actions by banking regulators, including changes in
laws, rules, and regulations
• actions taken by the Federal Reserve or the U.S.
government in response to the economic effects of
systemic events, such as the actions taken in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to an expansion of
the Federal Reserve balance sheet, growth in deposits
held by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial
institutions and, consequently, an increase in leverage
exposure and the GSIB surcharge
• changes in the composition of JPMorgan Chase’s
balance sheet or developments that could increase
RWA, such as increased market risk, customer
delinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or other
factors, and
• increases in estimated stress losses as determined by
the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive Capital
Analysis and Review, which could increase JPMorgan
Chase’s SCB.
Any failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain
the required level and composition of capital, or
unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements,
could have an adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase’s
shareholders, such as:
• reducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan
Chase is permitted to repurchase
• requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the
redemption of, capital instruments in a manner
inconsistent with JPMorgan Chase’s capital
management strategy
• constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid
on common stock, or
• curtailing JPMorgan Chase’s business activities or
operations.
Operational
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the
effectiveness of its operational systems and those of
other market participants.
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely on the ability of
JPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction
execution, data processing and other operational systems
to process, record, monitor and report a large number of
transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately,
quickly and securely. In addition to proper design,
installation, maintenance and training, the effective
Part I
20
functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems
depends on:
• the quality of the information contained in those
systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can
significantly compromise the functionality or reliability
of a particular system and other systems to which it
transmits or from which it receives information, and
• the ability of JPMorgan Chase to appropriately maintain
and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to
ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are
managed carefully to ensure security and operational
continuity and adherence to all applicable legal and
regulatory requirements.
JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and
use the operational systems of third parties, including its
custodians, vendors (such as those that provide data and
cloud computing services, and security and technology
services) and other market participants (such as clearing
and payment systems, CCPs and securities exchanges).
The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of
operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends,
including due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or
other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple
effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and
its clients and customers, including:
• delays or other disruptions in providing services,
liquidity or information to clients and customers
• the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to
funds and other assets, including those for which
physical settlement and delivery is required
• failure to timely settle or confirm transactions
• the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets
trades or other transactions are executed erroneously,
as a result of illegal conduct or with unintended
consequences
• financial losses, including due to loss-sharing
requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other
market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to
clients and customers
• higher operational costs associated with replacing
services provided by a system that is unavailable
• client or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan
Chase’s products and services
• limitations on JPMorgan Chase's ability to collect data
as required in connection with regulatory or other
investigations
• regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions against
JPMorgan Chase
• loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or
financial institutions generally, to protect against and
withstand operational disruptions, or
• harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.
As the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and
complexity of transactions continue to increase, it can
become more challenging to effectively maintain and
upgrade JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and
infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:
• attempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase or
its clients and customers may increase, evolve or
become more complex, particularly during periods of
market disruption or economic uncertainty
• errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market
participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause
widespread system disruption
• isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational
systems compound, or migrate to other systems over
time, to become larger issues
• failures in synchronization or encryption software, or
degraded performance of microprocessors, could cause
disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of
systems to communicate with each other, and
• third parties may attempt to block the use of key
technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes
on their intellectual property rights.
If JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of newlyacquired businesses or of external parties on which
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet
the requirements of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and
operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or
have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could
be materially and adversely affected.
A successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase could
cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and its clients
and customers.
JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyber attacks on its
computer systems, software, networks and other
technology assets on a daily basis from various actors,
including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries,
cyber-criminals, “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or groups
that use technology to promote a political agenda or social
change) and others. These cyber attacks can take many
forms, including attempts to introduce computer viruses or
malicious code, which are commonly referred to as
“malware,” into JPMorgan Chase’s systems. These attacks
are often designed to:
• obtain unauthorized access to confidential information
belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers,
counterparties or employees
• manipulate data
• destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering
services unavailable
• disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan
Chase’s systems
21
• steal money, or
• extort money through the use of so-called
“ransomware.”
JPMorgan Chase has also experienced:
• significant distributed denial-of-service attacks
intended to disrupt online banking services and other
business activities, and
• a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks
against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical
tensions.
JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to
cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional
breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could
result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan
Chase or its clients and customers.
A principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide
absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not
always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats
to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to implement effective
preventive measures against all breaches because:
• the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve frequently
and are increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may
not be recognized until launched
• cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of
sources, including JPMorgan Chase’s own employees,
cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to terrorist
organizations or hostile countries, or third parties
whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial
institutions more generally
• JPMorgan Chase does not have control over the
cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of
clients, customers, counterparties and third-party
service providers with which it does business, and
• it is possible that a third party, after establishing a
foothold on an internal network without being
detected, might obtain access to other networks and
systems.
The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could
increase in the future due to factors such as:
• JPMorgan Chase’s ongoing expansion of its mobile
banking and other internet-based product offerings and
its internal use of internet-based products and
applications, including those that use cloud computing
services
• the acquisition and integration of new businesses, and
• the increased use of remote access and third party
video conferencing solutions to facilitate work-fromhome arrangements for employees.
In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential
information obtained by intercepting signals or
communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan
Chase’s employees.
A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of
JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor,
governmental body or another market participant could
cause serious negative consequences, including:
• significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations
and those of its clients, customers and counterparties,
including losing access to operational systems
• misappropriation of confidential information of
JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers,
counterparties, employees or regulators
• disruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase’s systems
and those of its clients, customers and counterparties
• the inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully
recover and restore data that has been stolen,
manipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent
systems from processing fraudulent transactions
• violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and
other laws
• financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients,
customers, counterparties or employees
• loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity
and business resiliency measures
• dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients,
customers or counterparties
• significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines,
penalties or other sanctions, and
• harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.
The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that
JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack
may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant
amount of time before such an investigation can be
completed. While such an investigation is ongoing,
JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of
the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may
continue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan
Chase’s ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information
about the cyber attack to its clients, customers,
counterparties and regulators, as well as the public.
Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and
remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain
errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before
they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these
factors could further increase the costs and consequences
of a cyber attack.
Part I
22
JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to
identify and address operational risks associated with the
introduction of or changes to products, services and
delivery platforms.
When JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service,
introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of
products or services (including mobile connectivity,
electronic trading and cloud computing), acquires or invests
in a business or makes changes to an existing product,
service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or
identify new operational risks that may arise from those
changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to
mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any
significant failure in this regard could diminish JPMorgan
Chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or
result in:
• potential liability to clients, counterparties and
customers
• increased operating expenses
• higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines,
penalties and other sanctions
• damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation
• impairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity
• regulatory intervention, or
• weaker competitive standing.
Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and
adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of
operations.
JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and customer
satisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of
an external operational system.
External operational systems with which JPMorgan is
connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of
operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may
be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack
that may be experienced by a vendor or market
infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly
connected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack
involving another party to which such a vendor or
infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, payment
systems and processors, data aggregators and other
external parties with which JPMorgan Chase’s customers do
business can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational risk.
This is particularly the case where activities of customers or
other parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and
control systems, including through the use of the internet,
cloud computing services, and personal smart phones and
other mobile devices or services.
If an external party obtains access to customer account data
on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, whether authorized or
unauthorized, and that party experiences a cyberbreach of
its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could
result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase
and its clients and customers, including:
• heightened risk that external parties will be able to
execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan
Chase’s systems
• losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential
liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in
consumer protection laws, rules and regulations
• increased operational costs to remediate the
consequences of the external party’s security breach,
and
• reputational harm arising from the perception that
JPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.
As JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients,
customers and other external parties continues to expand,
JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational
failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those
parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase’s
clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures,
security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting
other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take
steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems
or to safeguard confidential information, including
restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These
actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs
and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and
confidence in JPMorgan Chase.
Furthermore, the widespread and expanding
interconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing
banks, CCPs, payments processors, financial technology
companies, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other
financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the
disruption of an operational system involving one institution
or entity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause
industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially
affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct business.
JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations rely on its
ability, and the ability of key external parties, to maintain
appropriately-staffed workforces, and on the
competence, trustworthiness, health and safety of
employees.
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses
efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that
meet the expectations of its clients and customers, and to
maintain an effective risk management framework is highly
dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately
and on the competence, integrity, health and safety of its
employees. JPMorgan Chase's businesses and operations
similarly rely on the workforces of third parties, including
employees of vendors, custodians and financial markets
infrastructures, and of businesses that it may seek to
acquire. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be materially
and adversely affected by:
• the ineffective implementation of business decisions
23
• any failure to institute controls that appropriately
address risks associated with business activities, or to
appropriately train employees with respect to those
risks and controls
• staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets
• the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan
Chase’s workforce are unable to work effectively,
including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-inplace arrangements, government actions or other
restrictions in connection with health emergencies, the
spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics
• a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft,
fraud or other unlawful conduct, or
• other negative outcomes caused by human error or
misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of
another party on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses
or operations depend.
JPMorgan Chase’s operations could also be impaired if the
measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to help
ensure the health and safety of its employees are
ineffective, or if any external party on which JPMorgan
Chase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions
to protect the health and safety of its employees.
JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational
risks in the processing and safeguarding of personal
information.
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to
complex and evolving laws, rules and regulations, both
within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and
protection of personal information of individuals.
Governmental authorities around the world have adopted
and are considering the adoption of numerous legislative
and regulatory initiatives concerning privacy, data
protection and security. Litigation or enforcement actions
relating to these laws, rules and regulations could result in
fines or orders requiring that JPMorgan Chase change its
data-related practices, which could have an adverse effect
on JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide products and
otherwise harm its business operations.
Implementing processes relating to JPMorgan Chase’s
collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information
to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in
all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of
different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:
• increase JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating
costs
• hinder the development of new products or services,
curtail the offering of existing products or services, or
affect how products and services are offered to clients
and customers
• demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s
management, and
• require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses,
operations and systems in less efficient ways.
Not all of JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers, vendors,
counterparties and other external parties may have
appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality,
integrity or availability of the information exchanged
between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where
information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan
Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines,
penalties or other sanctions if personal information of
clients, customers, employees or others were to be
mishandled or misused, such as situations where such
information is:
• erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted
to have the information, or
• intercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized
third parties.
Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s
measures to safeguard personal information, or even the
perception that those measures are inadequate, could
cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients
and customers or employees, and thereby reduce JPMorgan
Chase’s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived
failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable
privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations may
subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that
could result in requirements to modify or cease certain
operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory
fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could
damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and otherwise
adversely affect its businesses.
In recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the
inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of personal
information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of
practices relating to the processing or safeguarding of
personal information by companies in the U.S. and other
countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and
could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws,
rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing
and storage of personal information. These types of laws,
rules and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict
financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from
transferring information across national borders or sharing
information among affiliates or with third parties such as
vendors, thereby increase compliance costs, or could
restrict JPMorgan Chase’s use of personal information when
developing or offering products or services to customers.
Some countries are considering or have adopted legislation
implementing data protection requirements or requiring
local storage and processing of data which could increase
the cost and complexity of JPMorgan Chase’s delivery of
products and services. These restrictions could also inhibit
JPMorgan Chase’s development or marketing of certain
products or services, or increase the costs of offering them
to customers.
Part I
24
JPMorgan Chase’s operations, results and reputation
could be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events
beyond its control.
JPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems could
be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed,
by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially
beyond its control, including material instances of:
• cyber attacks
• security breaches of its physical premises, including
threats to health and safety
• power, telecommunications or internet outages, or
shutdowns of mass transit
• failure of, or loss of access to, technology or
operational systems, including any resulting loss of
critical data
• damage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan
Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries,
including in connection with any construction projects
undertaken by JPMorgan Chase
• effects of climate change
• natural disasters or severe weather conditions
• accidents such as explosions or structural failures
• health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases,
epidemics or pandemics, or
• events arising from local or larger-scale civil or political
unrest, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or
terrorist acts.
JPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide resiliency program
that is intended to enable it to recover critical business
functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology
and facilities, in the event of a business disruption,
including due to the occurrence of an extraordinary event
beyond its control. There can be no assurance that
JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all
potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase, its
clients, and customers and third parties with which it does
business, or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to
address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple
business disruption events. In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s
ability to respond effectively to a business disruption event
could be hampered to the extent that the members of its
workforce, physical assets or systems and other support
infrastructure needed to address the event are
geographically dispersed, or conversely, if such an event
were to occur in an area in which they are concentrated.
Further, should extraordinary events or the factors that
cause or contribute to those events become more chronic,
the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase’s
business and operations, and on its clients, customers,
counterparties and employees, could become more
significant and long-lasting.
Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s
operations or operational systems, or the occurrence of one
or more extraordinary events that are beyond its control,
could:
• hinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services to
its clients and customers or to transact with its
counterparties
• require it to expend significant resources to correct the
failure or disruption or to address the event
• cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss
of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries
• disrupt market infrastructure systems on which
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely
• expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or
other sanctions, and
• harm its reputation.
Enhanced regulatory and other standards for the
oversight of vendors and other service providers can
result in higher costs and other potential exposures.
JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and
other standards associated with doing business with
vendors and other service providers, including standards
relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the
performance of significant banking and other functions by
subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and
expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the
risks associated with oversight of its internal and external
service providers. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately
assess and manage these relationships, especially those
involving significant banking functions, shared services or
other critical activities, could materially adversely affect
JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result
in:
• potential harm to clients and customers, and any
liability associated with that harm
• regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions
• lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost
revenues
• increased operational costs, or
• harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.
JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework may not
be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to
JPMorgan Chase.
Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase’s risk
management framework, governance structure, practices,
models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected
losses, and its financial condition or results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected. Any such
inadequacy or lapse could:
25
• hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to
JPMorgan Chase’s senior management and Board of
Directors
• lead to business decisions that have negative outcomes
for JPMorgan Chase
• require significant resources and time to remediate
• lead to non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations
• attract heightened regulatory scrutiny
• expose JPMorgan Chase to litigation, regulatory
investigations or regulatory fines, penalties or other
sanctions
• lead to potential harm to customers and clients, and
any liability associated with that harm
• harm its reputation, or
• otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.
JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk
exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of
JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering, analysis and validation
processes could result in ineffective risk management
practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate
or untimely risk reporting.
Many of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies and
techniques consider historical market behavior and to some
degree are based on management’s subjective judgment or
assumptions. For example, many models used by JPMorgan
Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical
correlations among prices of various asset classes or other
market indicators. In times of market stress, including
difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event
of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated
indicators may become correlated. Conversely, previouslycorrelated indicators may become uncorrelated at those
times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated
market or economic movements could, in some
circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s
risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.
JPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its
capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater
regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations or
judgments, including those used in its financial
statements, prove to be inadequate or incorrect.
JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of
models and other analytical and judgment-based
estimations to measure, monitor and implement controls
over its market, credit, capital, liquidity, operational and
other risks. JPMorgan Chase also uses internal models and
estimations as a basis for its stress testing and in
connection with the preparation of its financial statements
under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
GAAP”).
These models and estimations are based on a variety of
assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically
reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and
estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective
in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a
variety of factors, such as:
• reliance on historical trends that may not persist in the
future, including assumptions underlying the models
and estimations such as correlations among certain
market indicators or asset prices
• inherent limitations associated with forecasting
uncertain economic and financial outcomes
• historical trend information may be incomplete, or may
not be indicative of severely negative market
conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack
of liquidity
• sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of
certain loans and securities may make it more difficult
to value certain financial instruments
• technology that is introduced to run models or
estimations may not perform as expected, or may not
be well understood by the personnel using the
technology
• models and estimations may contain erroneous data,
valuations, formulas or algorithms, and
• review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and
estimations.
JPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if
models, estimates or judgments used or applied in
connection with its risk management activities or the
preparation of its financial statements prove to have been
inadequate or incorrect. For example, where quoted market
prices are not available for certain financial instruments
that require a determination of their fair value, JPMorgan
Chase may make fair value determinations based on
internally developed models or other means which
ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates
and judgment.
Similarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for
expected credit losses related to its credit exposures which
requires significant judgments, including forecasts of how
macroeconomic conditions might impair the ability of
JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers to repay their
loans or other obligations. These types of estimates and
judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of
factors, as noted above. This is particularly true when the
current and forecasted environments are significantly
different from the historical environments upon which the
models were developed, as JPMorgan Chase experienced
during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of
judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that
JPMorgan Chase may make to model outputs than would
otherwise be the case.
Some of the models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing
Part I
26
risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of,
JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These reviews are required
before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and
estimations for calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA
and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan
Chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its
regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges,
which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the
ability to expand its businesses.
Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting
could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability or
reputation.
There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s
disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every
circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant
deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will
not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could result in
inaccurate financial reporting which, in turn, could:
• materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s
business and results of operations or financial
condition
• restrict its ability to access the capital markets
• require it to expend significant resources to correct the
lapses or deficiencies
• expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or
other sanctions
• harm its reputation, or
• otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan
Chase.
Strategic
If JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and
execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate
changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chase’s
competitive standing and results could suffer.
JPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly affect its
competitive standing and operations. These strategies
relate to:
• the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers
• the geographies in which it operates
• the types of clients and customers that it serves
• the businesses that it acquires or in which it invests
• the counterparties with which it does business, and
• the methods and distribution channels by which it
offers products and services.
If management makes choices about these strategies and
goals that prove to be incorrect, are based on incomplete,
inaccurate or fraudulent information, do not accurately
assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or
fail to address changing regulatory and market
environments or the expectations of clients, customers,
investors, employees and other stakeholders, then the
franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase’s
businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline.
JPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on
management’s ability to develop and execute effective
business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in
the near term and over longer time horizons. Management’s
effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase’s
ability to develop and enhance its resources, control
expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these
objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the
part of management to:
• devise effective business plans and strategies
• offer products and services that meet changing
expectations of clients and customers
• allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term
stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest
in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed
environment
• allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise
modeling or subjective judgments made in connection
with those allocations
• conduct appropriate due diligence on prospective
business acquisitions or investments, or effectively
integrate newly-acquired businesses
• appropriately address concerns of clients, customers,
investors, employees and other stakeholders, including
with respect to ESG matters
• react quickly to changes in market conditions or market
structures, or
• develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk,
financial and managerial resources necessary to grow
and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.
Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in
connection with disposing of excess properties, premises
and facilities, and those costs could be material to its
results of operations in a given period.
JPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing
competition in the rapidly evolving financial services
industry.
JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive
environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the
significant changes as a result of changes in financial
regulation, technological advances, increased public
scrutiny and changes in economic conditions. JPMorgan
Chase expects that competition in the U.S. and global
financial services industry will continue to be intense.
Competitors include:
• other banks and financial institutions
• trading, advisory and investment management firms
• finance companies
27
• technology companies, and
• other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing
similar as well as new products and services.
JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the
significant competition in the financial services industry will
not materially and adversely affect its future results of
operations. For example, aggressive or less disciplined
lending practices by nonbank competitors could lead to a
loss of market share for traditional banks, and in an
economic downturn could result in instability in the
financial services industry and adversely impact other
market participants, including JPMorgan Chase.
New competitors in the financial services industry continue
to emerge. For example, technological advances and the
growth of e-commerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that
traditionally were banking products. These advances have
also allowed financial institutions and other companies to
provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions,
including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading,
lending and other extensions of credit to consumers,
payments processing and online automated algorithmicbased investment advice. Furthermore, both financial
institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk
that payments processing and other products and services,
including deposits and other traditional banking products,
could be significantly disrupted by the use of new
technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other
applications using secure distributed ledgers, that require
no intermediation. New technologies have required and
could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or
adapt its products to attract and retain clients and
customers or to match products and services offered by its
competitors, including technology companies. In addition,
new technologies may be used by customers, or breached
or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which
can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for complying with
laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of
products and services through those technologies and
reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from
providing products and services through those
technologies.
Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the
pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may
cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly
with respect to traditional banking products. This
competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of
products and services offered, transaction execution,
innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of
clients and customers, whether due to general market
conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a
particular product or service, changes in client and
customer expectations or other factors, could affect
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and
customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce
JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also
may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital
investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its
capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain
competitive.
The effects of climate change could adversely affect
JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, both directly
and as a result of impacts on its clients and customers.
JPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and
communities around the world where its business, and the
activities of its clients and customers, could be adversely
affected by climate change. Climate change could manifest
as a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase either through
changes in the physical climate or from the process of
transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Both physical
risks and transition risks associated with climate change
could have negative impacts on the financial condition or
creditworthiness of JPMorgan’s clients and customers, and
on its exposure to those clients and customers.
Climate-related physical risks include the increased
frequency or severity of acute weather events, such as
floods, wildfires and tropical storms, and chronic shifts in
the climate, such as persistent changes in precipitation
levels, rising sea levels, or increases in average ambient
temperature.Potential adverse impacts of climate-related
physical risks include:
• declines in asset values, including due to the
destruction or degradation of property
• reduced availability or increased cost of insurance for
clients of JPMorgan Chase
• interruptions to business operations, including supply
chain disruption, and
• population migration or unemployment in affected
regions.
Transition risks arise from societal adjustment to a lowercarbon economy, such as changes in public policy, adoption
of new technologies or changes in consumer preferences
towards low-carbon goods and services. These risks could
also be influenced by changes in the physical climate.
Potential adverse impacts of transition risks include:
• sudden devaluation of assets, including unanticipated
write-downs (“stranded assets”)
• increased operational and compliance costs driven by
changes in climate policy
• increased energy costs driven by governmental actions
and initiatives such as higher taxation and accelerated
decarbonization policies
• negative consequences to business models, and the
need to make changes in response to those
consequences, and
• damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation, including due
to any perception that its business practices are
Part I
28
contrary to public policy or the preferences of different
stakeholders.
Climate risks can also arise from the inconsistencies and
conflicts in the manner in which climate policy and financial
regulation is implemented in the many regions where
JPMorgan Chase operates, including initiatives to apply and
enforce policy and regulation with extraterritorial effect.
Conduct
Conduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm
clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage
JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and
regulatory action.
JPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients,
customers and counterparties, and with each other, every
day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and
exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan
Chase’s Code of Conduct and How We Do Business
Principles, including JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to “do
first class business in a first class way.” JPMorgan Chase
endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout
an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding,
training and development, and performance
management. Conduct risk management is also an integral
component of JPMorgan Chase’s promotion and
compensation processes.
Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices,
certain employees have engaged in improper or illegal
conduct in the past. These instances of misconduct have
resulted in litigation, and resolutions of governmental
investigations or enforcement actions involving consent
orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution
agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is
no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions
by employees have not occurred or will not occur, lead to a
violation of the terms of these resolutions (and associated
consequences), or that any such actions will always be
detected, deterred or prevented.
JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and
collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one
or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance
with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices,
including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers,
other market participants, employees or others. Some
examples of this include:
• improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s
products or services
• engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or
unauthorized trading
• engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in
connection with government relief programs
• facilitating a transaction where a material objective is
to achieve a particular tax, accounting or financial
disclosure treatment that may be subject to scrutiny by
governmental or regulatory authorities, or where the
proposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect the
economic substance of the transaction
• failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties
owed to clients or customers
• violating antitrust or anti-competition laws by colluding
with other market participants
• using electronic communications channels that have
not been approved by JPMorgan Chase
• engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment
with respect to clients, customers or employees, or
acting contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a
diverse and inclusive workplace
• managing or reporting risks in ways that subordinate
JPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to business
performance goals or employee compensation
objectives, and
• misappropriating property, confidential or proprietary
information, or technology assets belonging to
JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third
parties.
The consequences of any failure by one or more employees
to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s
expectations, policies or practices could include litigation,
or regulatory or other governmental investigations or
enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions
could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or
other sanctions, or lead to:
• financial losses
• increased operational and compliance costs
• greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties
• regulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to
restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities
• the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s
management
• loss of clients or customers, and
• harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.
The foregoing risks could be heightened with respect to
newly-acquired businesses if JPMorgan Chase fails to
successfully integrate employees of those businesses or any
of those employees do not conduct themselves in
accordance with JPMorgan Chase's expectations, policies
and practices.
Reputation
Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its
businesses.
Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability
to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and
employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can
therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase’s
29
business and prospects, and can arise from numerous
sources, including:
• employee misconduct, including discriminatory
behavior or harassment with respect to clients,
customers or employees, or actions that are contrary to
JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and
inclusive workplace
• security breaches, including as a result of cyber attacks
• failure to safeguard client, customer or employee
information
• failure to manage risks associated with its business
activities or those of its clients, including those that
may be unpopular among one or more constituencies
• failure to meet publicly-announced commitments to
support ESG initiatives
• non-compliance with laws, rules, and regulations
• operational failures
• litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other
sanctions
• actions taken in executing regulatory and
governmental requirements during a global or regional
health emergency, spread of infectious disease,
epidemic or pandemic
• regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or
resolutions of these matters, and
• failure or perceived failure to comply with laws, rules
or regulations by JPMorgan Chase or its clients,
customers, counterparties or other parties, including
newly-acquired businesses, companies in which
JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments,
parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and
vendors with which JPMorgan Chase does business.
JPMorgan Chase’s reputation may be significantly damaged
by adverse publicity or negative information regarding
JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be
published or broadcast by the media or posted on social
media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the
internet. This latter risk can be magnified by the speed and
pervasiveness with which information is disseminated
through those channels.
Social and environmental activists have been increasingly
targeting JPMorgan Chase and other financial services firms
with public criticism concerning their business practices,
including business relationships with clients that are
engaged in certain sensitive industries, such as companies :
• whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to
human health, or
• whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to
negatively affect the environment, workers’ rights or
communities.
Activists have also taken actions intended to change or
influence JPMorgan Chase’s business practices with respect
to ESG matters, including public protests at JPMorgan
Chase’s headquarters and other properties, and submitting
specific ESG-related proposals for a vote by JPMorgan
Chase’s shareholders.
These and other types of activist criticism and actions
directed at JPMorgan Chase could potentially engender
dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors and
employees with how JPMorgan Chase addresses ESG
concerns in its business activities. In all of these cases, the
resulting harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could:
• attract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory
bodies
• cause certain clients and customers to cease doing
business with JPMorgan Chase
• impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new clients
and customers, or to expand its relationships with
existing clients and customers
• diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to hire or retain
employees
• prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with
certain clients or customers
• cause certain investors to divest from investments in
securities of JPMorgan Chase, or
• otherwise negatively affect JPMorgan Chase's business
and results of operations.
Actions by the financial services industry generally or
individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase’s
reputation. For example, the reputation of the industry as a
whole can be damaged by concerns that:
• consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial
institution, or
• a financial institution has acted inappropriately with
respect to the methods used to offer products to
customers.
If JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these
types of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation among
clients or customers.
Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of
interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can result in
litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage
JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of
interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its
business activities which encompass a variety of
transactions, obligations and interests with and among
JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase
can become subject to litigation, enforcement actions, and
heightened regulatory scrutiny, and its reputation can be
damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:
Part I
30
• adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts
of interest, including potential conflicts of interest that
may arise in connection with providing multiple
products and services in, or having one or more
investments related to, the same transaction
• identify and address any conflict of interest that a third
party with which it is does business may have with
respect to a transaction involving JPMorgan Chase
• deliver appropriate standards of service and quality
• treat clients and customers fairly and with the
appropriate standard of care
• use client and customer data responsibly and in a
manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory
expectations
• provide fiduciary products or services in accordance
with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or
• handle or use confidential information of customers or
clients appropriately and in compliance with applicable
data protection and privacy laws, rules and regulations.
A failure or perceived failure to appropriately address
conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in
customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines,
penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory
scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to
lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious
harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.
Country
An outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries
or within a country or region could have a material
adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan
Chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally.
Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups,
including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks, could
expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries
or escalating into full-scale war with potentially
catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of
the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the
scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:
• worldwide economic disruption
• heightened volatility in financial markets
• severe declines in asset values, accompanied by
widespread sell-offs of investments
• substantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially
leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in
the affected region
• disruption of global trade, and
• diminished consumer, business and investor
confidence.
Any of the above consequences could have significant
negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s operations and
earnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected
by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to
become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead
to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase
may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in
any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities.
JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and
aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the
sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a
conflict.
JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations in certain
countries can be adversely affected by local economic,
political, regulatory and social factors.
Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts
business have economies or markets that are less
developed and more volatile or may have political, legal and
regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable
than other countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. In
addition, in some jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase
conducts business, the local economy and business
activities are subject to substantial government influence or
control. Some of these countries have in the past
experienced economic disruptions, including:
• extreme currency fluctuations
• high inflation
• low or negative growth, and
• defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt.
The governments in these countries have sometimes
reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive
policies that adversely affect the local and regional business
environment, such as:
• price, capital or exchange controls, including
imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility
restrictions or forced currency exchange
• expropriation or nationalization of assets or
confiscation of property, including intellectual
property, and
• changes in laws, rules and regulations.
The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading
markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than
more-developed markets. These types of government
actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations
in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the
business activities of local clients or multi-national clients
that conduct business in the jurisdiction.
In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as more
developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable
social developments arising from poor economic conditions
or governmental actions, including:
• widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general
strikes
• crime and corruption
31
• security and personal safety issues
• an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other
geopolitical instabilities
• overthrow of incumbent governments
• terrorist attacks, and
• other forms of internal discord.
These economic, political, regulatory and social
developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future
could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan
Chase’s operations in those countries and impair the
revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In
addition, any of these events or circumstances in one
country can affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and
investments in another country or countries, including in
the U.S.
People
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified
and diverse employees is critical to its success.
JPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important
resource, and in many areas of the financial services
industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense.
JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse
new employees and retain, develop and motivate its
existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's efforts to retain
talented and diverse employees can be particularly
challenging when members of its workforce are targeted for
recruitment by competitors. If JPMorgan Chase were unable
to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse
employees, including successors to the Chief Executive
Officer, members of the Operating Committee and other
senior leaders, JPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its
competitive position, could be materially and adversely
affected.
JPMorgan Chase’s increased use of hybrid work models
could result in deterioration in employee performance or
degradation of JPMorgan Chase's control environment
which may have a material and adverse effect on its
business and operations. Alternatively, discontinuing hybrid
work models could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract
and retain employees.
Unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies
could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and
operations.
JPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and
expertise of employees located throughout the world.
Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. and
other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it
more difficult for employees or their family members to
work in, or travel to or transfer between, jurisdictions in
which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its
business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract
and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the
quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to
make structural changes to its worldwide or regional
operating models that cause its operations to be less
efficient or more costly.
Legal
JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from
litigation and formal and informal regulatory and
government investigations.
JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise
involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions
and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions
currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions
adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could
materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business,
financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious
reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services
industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to
experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and
government investigations related to its businesses and
operations.
Regulators and other government agencies conduct
examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both
on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan
Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to
heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened
regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation
or examination, may lead to additional regulatory
investigations or enforcement actions. There is no
assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or
other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase.
Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation
of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and
overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by
multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the
U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other
governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.
If another financial institution violates a law or regulation
relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will
often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other
governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or
practice by JPMorgan Chase.
These and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S.
governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions,
and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its
operations and activities or to cease offering certain
products or services. All of these potential outcomes could
harm JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or lead to higher
operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s
profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In
addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal
and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in
some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan
Chase has established for those matters.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
The internal control framework promulgated by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”), “Internal Control — Integrated
Framework” (“COSO 2013”), provides guidance for
designing, implementing and conducting internal control
and assessing its effectiveness. The Firm used the COSO
2013 framework to assess the effectiveness of the Firm’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2022. Refer to “Management’s report on internal control
over financial reporting” on page 155.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with
the participation of the Firm’s management, including its
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation,
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and
31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
respectively.
The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of
internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless,
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls
may occur from time to time, and there can be no
assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal
control in the future and collateral consequences
therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal
control over financial reporting” on page 155 for further
information. There was no change in the Firm’s internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that
occurred during the three months ended December 31,
2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial
reporting.

Firmwide overview
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $37.7 billion for
2022, down 22%, earnings per share of $12.09, ROE of
14% and ROTCE of 18%.
• Total net revenue was $128.7 billion, up 6%, reflecting:
– Net interest income of $66.7 billion, up 28%, driven by
higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower
Markets net interest income. Net interest income
excluding Markets was $62.4 billion, up 40%.
– Noninterest revenue of $62.0 billion, down 11%,
driven by lower Investment Banking fees, $2.4 billion
of net investment securities losses in Treasury and CIO,
lower net production revenue in Home Lending and
lower auto operating lease income, largely offset by
higher CIB Markets revenue and a $914 million gain on
the sale of Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B
shares”) in Corporate.
• Noninterest expense was $76.1 billion, up 7%, driven by
higher structural expense and continued investments in
the business, including compensation, technology and
marketing, partially offset by lower volume- and revenuerelated expense.
• The provision for credit losses was $6.4 billion,
reflecting:
– a net addition of $3.5 billion to the allowance for credit
losses, consisting of $2.3 billion in wholesale and $1.2
billion in consumer, driven by loan growth and
deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook,
partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related
to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower
behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually
recede, and
– $2.9 billion of net charge-offs.
The prior year provision was a net benefit of $9.3 billion,
reflecting a net reduction to the allowance for credit
losses of $12.1 billion.
• The total allowance for credit losses was $22.2 billion at
December 31, 2022. The Firm had an allowance for loan
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.81%,
compared with 1.62% in the prior year.
• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $7.2 billion at
December 31, 2022, a net decrease of $1.1 billion,
predominantly driven by lower consumer nonaccrual
loans, reflecting improved credit performance and loan
sales.
• Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 6%,
driven by higher loans across the LOBs.
• Firmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up 5%,
reflecting:
– growth in CCB from existing and new accounts, and net
inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of
certain government actions, partially offset by the
impact of growth in customer spending in CCB and
migration into investments in AWM, and
– reductions in CIB and CB due to attrition driven by the
rising interest rate environment.
Selected capital and other metrics
• CET1 capital was $219 billion, and the Standardized and
Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.2% and 13.6%,
respectively.
• SLR was 5.6%.
• TBVPS grew by 2%, ending 2022 at $73.12.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 47
• As of December 31, 2022, the Firm had average eligible
High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately
$733 billion and unencumbered marketable securities
with a fair value of approximately $694 billion, resulting
in approximately $1.4 trillion of liquidity sources. Refer
to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for
additional information.
Refer to Consolidated Result of Operations and
Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 51-54 and
pages 55-56, respectively, for a further discussion of the
Firm's results.

excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a managed
basis are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of NonGAAP Financial Measures on pages 58-60 for a further
discussion of each of these measures.

Outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on
the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s
management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K,
and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to
Forward-Looking Statements on page 154, and the Risk
Factors section on pages 9-32 of this Form 10-K for a further
discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the
other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual
results to differ materially because of those risks and
uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results in
2023 will be in line with the outlook information set forth
below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any
forward-looking statements.
JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2023 should
be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S.
economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical
environment, the competitive environment, client and
customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative
developments in the U.S. and other countries where the
Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the
performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to make
appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in
response to ongoing developments in the business,
economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it
operates.
Full-year 2023
• Management expects net interest income to be
approximately $73 billion, market dependent.
• Management expects net interest income excluding
Markets to be approximately $74 billion, market
dependent.
• Management expects adjusted expense to be
approximately $81 billion, market dependent.
• Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card
Services to be approximately 2.6%.
Net interest income excluding Markets and adjusted
expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of NonGAAP Financial Measures on pages 58-60.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 49
Business Developments
War in Ukraine
The duration and potential outcomes of the war in Ukraine
remain uncertain. The Firm has taken and continues to take
steps to close positions and reduce certain of its business
activities and exposures connected with the war, and to
assist clients with fulfilling any pre-existing obligations and
managing their Russia-related risks.
The Firm’s exposure to Russia and Russia-associated clients
and counterparties is not material to its financial condition
or results of operations. However, the Firm continues to
monitor potential secondary impacts of the war, including
increased market volatility, inflationary pressures and the
effects of financial and economic sanctions imposed by
various governments, that could have adverse effects on the
Firm’s businesses.
The Firm also continues to monitor and manage the
operational risks associated with the war, including
compliance with the financial and economic sanctions and
the increased risk of cyber attacks.
Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 116-126,
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 127-129, Market Risk
Management on pages 131-138, Country Risk Management
on pages 139-140 and Operational Risk Management on
pages 142-144 for additional information.
For purposes of this Form 10-K, “Russia” refers to exposure
to clients and counterparties of the Firm for which the
largest proportion of their assets is located, or the largest
proportion of their revenue is derived, in Russia, based on
the Firm’s internal country risk management framework; and
“Russia-associated” refers to exposure to clients and
counterparties of the Firm with respect to which economic or
financial sanctions relating to the war in Ukraine have been
imposed or which have close association with Russia.
Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
The Firm and other market participants are preparing for the
final stages of the transition from the use of the London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other IBORs in
accordance with the International Organization of Securities
Commission’s standards for transaction-based benchmark
rates. The cessation of the publication of the remaining
principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, onemonth, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR)
(“LIBOR Cessation”) is scheduled for June 30, 2023.
As of December 31, 2022, the Firm had significantly reduced
the notional amount of its exposure to contracts that
reference U.S. dollar LIBOR, including in derivatives, bilateral
and syndicated loans, securities, and debt and preferred
stock issuances, and is on-track to meet both its internal
milestones for contract remediation as well as the industry
milestones and recommendations published by National
Working Groups, including the Alternative Reference Rates
Committee in the U.S. The Firm also continues to engage
with clients to assist them with transitioning their U.S. dollar
LIBOR-linked contracts to replacement rates in anticipation
of LIBOR Cessation. The majority of the Firm’s remaining
LIBOR exposure is to derivative contracts. The Firm will be
participating in initiatives by the principal central
counterparties (“CCPs”) to convert cleared derivatives
contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR in the second quarter of
2023 which will remediate approximately 40% of the Firm’s
remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR derivatives exposure. The Firm
expects that the majority of the remaining derivatives
exposure will be remediated predominantly through
contractual fallback provisions.
On March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act
(“LIBOR Act”) was signed into law in the U.S. The LIBOR Act
provides a framework for replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR as the
reference rate in legacy financial contracts that may not
otherwise transition to a replacement rate upon LIBOR
Cessation. In addition, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority is
proposing that the administrator of LIBOR be required to
continue to publish the one-month, three-month and sixmonth tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a “synthetic” basis
which would allow market participants to use such rates
through September 30, 2024. This proposal would apply to
contracts that are outside the scope of the LIBOR Act,
including U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts that are not
governed by U.S. law. Both the LIBOR Act and the proposed
publication of “synthetic” LIBOR are intended to facilitate,
and reduce the risks associated with, the transition from
LIBOR, including the potential for disputes or litigation.
The Firm continues to make necessary changes to its risk
management systems in connection with the transition from
LIBOR, including modifications to its operational systems and
models. In addition, the Firm continues to monitor and
evaluate client, industry, market, regulatory and legislative
developments relating to the transition from LIBOR. Refer to
Part 1, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages 9-32 of the 2022
Form 10-K and to Accounting and Reporting Developments
on page 153 for additional information.

respectively. Also includes losses on tax-oriented investments. Refer to
Note 6 for additional information.
2022 compared with 2021
Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, as volatile
market conditions resulted in:
• lower equity and debt underwriting fees due to lower
issuance activity, and
• lower advisory fees driven by a lower level of announced
deals.
Refer to CIB segment results on pages 67-72 and Note 6 for
additional information.
Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting:
• higher net revenue in Fixed Income Markets, driven by a
strong performance in the macro businesses amid volatile
market conditions, particularly Currencies & Emerging
Markets and Rates, partially offset by lower revenue in
Securitized Products and Credit, and
• higher revenue associated with Equity Derivatives and
Prime Finance in Equity Markets,
largely offset by
• a loss of $836 million in Credit Adjustments & Other in
CIB, compared with a gain of $250 million in the prior
year. The loss in the current year reflected funding
spread widening and, to a lesser extent, losses on
exposures relating to commodities and Russia and Russiaassociated counterparties,
• net markdowns recorded in the second quarter of 2022
on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded
commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and
CB,
• higher net losses on certain legacy private equity
investments in Corporate, and
• net losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment
transactions, which were more than offset by the related
net interest income earned on those transactions.
Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases
have offsets across other revenue lines, including net
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its
CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.
Refer to CIB, CB and Corporate segment results on pages
67-72, pages 73-75 and pages 79-80, respectively, and
Note 6 for additional information.
Lending- and deposit-related fees increased due to higher
service fee volume in CCB, predominantly offset by lower
cash management fees in CB and CIB due to a higher level
of credits earned by clients and applied against such fees.
Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 63-66,
pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for
additional information.
Asset management, administration and commissions
revenue decreased driven by:
• lower asset management fees in AWM resulting from
lower average market levels, predominantly offset by the
removal of most money market fund fee waivers, and net
long-term inflows,
• lower custody fees in Securities Services, primarily
associated with lower average market values of assets
under custody, and
• lower brokerage commissions, largely in AWM, reflecting
reduced volumes,
partially offset by
• higher commissions on travel-related services and
annuity sales in CCB.
Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages
63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 76-78, respectively, and
Note 6 for additional information.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 51
Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected higher net
losses on sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and
U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the
investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. Refer to
Corporate segment results on pages 79-80 and Note 10 for
additional information.
Mortgage fees and related income decreased driven by
Home Lending, reflecting:
• lower production revenue due to lower margins and
volume,
largely offset by
• higher net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting
– the absence of a net loss in MSR risk management in
the prior year primarily driven by updates to model
inputs related to prepayment expectations, and
– higher operating revenue due to a higher level of thirdparty loans serviced.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 63-66, Note 6 and
15 for further information.
Card income decreased driven by higher amortization
related to new account origination costs, partially offset by
higher annual fees in CCB, and higher payments revenue on
volume growth in commercial cards in CIB and CB.
Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 63-66,
pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for
further information.
Other income decreased reflecting:
• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a
decline in volume, and
• net losses on certain investments in CIB and AWM,
compared with net gains in the prior year,
partially offset by
• an increase in Other Corporate from:
– a gain of $914M on the sale of Visa B shares,
– higher net gains related to certain other investments,
and
– proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first
quarter of 2022,
• a gain on an equity-method investment received in partial
satisfaction of a loan in CB,
• the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates
related to net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO,
primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar, and
• the absence of weather-related write-downs recorded in
the prior year on certain renewable energy investments
in CIB.
Refer to Note 2 for additional information on Visa B shares.
Net interest income increased driven by higher rates and
loan growth, partially offset by lower Markets NII.
The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.3
trillion, up $133 billion, and the yield was 2.78%, up 97
basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an
FTE basis, was 2.00%, an increase of 36 bps. The net yield
excluding Markets was 2.60%, up 69 bps.
Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest
and rates schedule on pages 292-296 for further
information. Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP
financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation
of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages
58-60 for a further discussion of Net yield excluding
Markets.

Provision for credit losses
Year ended December 31,
(in millions) 2022 2021 2020
Consumer, excluding credit card $ 506 $ (1,933) $ 1,016

Investment securities 54 (36) 68
Total provision for credit losses $ 6,389 $ (9,256) $ 17,480
2022 compared with 2021
The provision for credit losses was $6.4 billion, reflecting a
net addition of $3.5 billion to the allowance for credit
losses and $2.9 billion of net charge-offs. The net addition
to the allowance for credit losses consisted of:
• $2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the
Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, and loan growth
predominantly in CB and CIB, and
• $1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card
Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances and
deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook,
partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to
a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower
behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.
The prior year included a $12.1 billion net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses.
Deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook included
both updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of
2022, which now reflects a mild recession, as well as the
impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse
scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the
effects associated with higher inflation, changes in
monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in
Ukraine.
Net charge-offs were $2.9 billion, flat compared with 2021,
and included:
• a $309 million decrease in Card Services, reflecting the
ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However,
median deposit balances declined in the second half of
2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending,
offset by
• a $190 million increase in net charge-offs in Auto and
Banking & Wealth Management (“BWM”) as net chargeoffs in the prior year benefited from government stimulus
and payment assistance programs, and an increase of
$76 million in CIB.
Refer to the segment discussions of CCB on pages 63-66,

(b) Included Firmwide legal expense of $266 million, $426 million and
$1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.
2022 compared with 2021
Compensation expense increased driven by additional
headcount, primarily in technology and operations, as well
as front office, and the impact of inflation, partially offset
by lower revenue-related compensation in CIB.
Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:
• higher investments in the business, including marketing
and technology, and
• higher structural expense, including travel and
entertainment; regulatory assessments; occupancy
expense associated with higher utilities and exit costs of
certain leases; and other employee-related expense,
partially offset by
• lower volume-related expense, reflecting lower
depreciation expense on lower Auto lease assets; and
lower distribution fees in AWM, partially offset by higher
operating losses and outside services, both in CCB; and
• lower legal expense.
The prior year included a $550 million contribution to the
Firm's Foundation.
Income tax expense

Effective tax rate 18.4 % 18.9 % 18.7 %
2022 compared with 2021
The effective tax rate decreased driven by income tax
benefits compared with income tax expense in the prior
year related to tax audit settlements, largely offset by other
tax adjustments and a change in the level and mix of
income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and
local taxes. Refer to Note 25 for further information.

Other assets 182,884 181,498 1
Total assets $ 3,665,743 $ 3,743,567 (2) %
Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
decreased primarily as a result of lower deposits across the
LOBs and loan growth. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s
placement of its excess cash with various central banks,
including the Federal Reserve Banks.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements increased, reflecting:
• the impact of a lower level of netting on client-driven
market-making activities and on collateral requirements in
Markets,
• higher demand for securities to cover short positions in
Fixed Income Markets, and
• an increase in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO.
Securities borrowed decreased driven by Markets, reflecting
lower client-driven activities and lower demand for securities
to cover short positions in Equity Markets.
Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities
purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed.
Trading assets increased due to:
• higher derivative receivables, primarily in foreign
exchange, as a result of market movements, and
• an increase in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO.
Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.
Investment securities decreased, driven by lower availablefor-sale (“AFS”) securities, partially offset by higher held-tomaturity (“HTM”) securities, which includes the impact of the
transfer of $78.3 billion of securities from AFS to HTM in
2022, for capital management purposes.
• The decrease in AFS securities was also due to paydowns,
as well as unrealized losses, which are recognized in
accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”),
largely offset by net purchases, and
• the increase in HTM securities also reflected purchases
partially offset by paydowns.
Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 79-80,
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 130 and
Notes 2 and 10 for additional information on investment
securities.
Loans increased, reflecting:
• higher balances in Card Services driven by higher
consumer spending and net new originations,
• higher originations and revolver utilization in CB, and
• higher wholesale loans in CIB,
partially offset by
• lower mortgage warehouse loans in Home Lending as sales
outpaced originations due to higher interest rates, and
• the impact from PPP loan forgiveness in BWM.
The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a net
addition of $3.3 billion to the allowance for loan losses,
consisting of:
• $2.1 billion in wholesale, resulting from deterioration in
the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, and loan growth
predominantly in CB and CIB, and
• $1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card
Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances, and
deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook,
partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a
decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior
as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.
There was also a $121 million addition to the allowance for
lending-related commitments recognized in other liabilities
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 55
on the Consolidated balance sheets, and a $54 million
addition to the allowance for investment securities.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
106-130, and Notes 1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 for further discussion
of loans and the allowance for loan losses.
Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased due to
higher client receivables related to client-driven activities in
Markets, as well as higher receivables in Payments related to
the timing of payment activities, with December 31, 2022
falling on a weekend.
Premises and equipment, refer to Note 16 and 18 for
additional information.
Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased reflecting:
• higher MSRs as a result of higher market interest rates and
net additions, partially offset by the realization of expected
cash flows, and
• additions to goodwill associated with the acquisitions of
Renovite Technologies, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2022,
Global Shares PLC and Figg, Inc. in the third quarter of
2022, and Frosch Travel Group, LLC and Volkswagen
Payments S.A. in the second quarter of 2022.
Refer to Note 15 for additional information.
Other assets increased predominantly due to the impact of
securities financing activities in Markets, offset by lower auto
operating lease assets in CCB.

Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 3,665,743 $ 3,743,567 (2) %
Deposits decreased reflecting:
• attrition in CB and CIB, particularly non-operating deposits
in CB, partially offset by net issuances of structured notes
in Markets,
• net outflows into investments in AWM amid the rising
interest rate environment, and
• a decline in balances in existing accounts in CCB due to
higher customer spending, predominantly offset by net
inflows into new accounts.
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements increased due to:
• higher secured financing of trading assets in Markets,
partially offset by
• lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in
Treasury and CIO.
Short-term borrowings decreased predominantly as a result
of lower financing requirements in Markets.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for
additional information on deposits, federal funds purchased
and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements,
and short-term borrowings; and also to Notes 2 and 17 for
deposits and Note 11 for federal funds purchased and
securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.
Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven marketmaking activities, which resulted in higher levels of short
positions in Markets. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional
information.
Accounts payable and other liabilities increased due to
higher client payables related to client-driven activities in
Markets, including Prime Finance, as well as higher payables
in Payments related to the timing of payment activities, with
December 31, 2022 falling on a weekend. Refer to Note 19
for additional information.
Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased
driven by higher issuance of commercial paper as a result of
an increase in loan balances in the Firm-administered multiseller conduits. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
97-104; and Notes 14 and 28 for additional information on
Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.
Long-term debt decreased driven by:
• fair value hedge accounting adjustments in Treasury and
CIO as a result of higher rates, and a decline in the fair
value of structured notes in Markets,
largely offset by
• net issuances of senior debt in Treasury and CIO and
structured notes in Markets. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 97-104 and Note 20 for additional
information.
Stockholders’ equity reflects net unrealized losses in AOCI,
predominantly driven by the impact of higher interest rates
on the AFS portfolio and cash flow hedges in Treasury and
CIO. Refer to Consolidated Statements of Changes in
Stockholders’ Equity on page 162, Capital Actions on page
94, and Note 24 for additional information.

Operating activities
JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily
support the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities.
These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the
normal course of business due to the amount and timing of
cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk
management activities and market conditions. The Firm
believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and
other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash
through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to
meet its operating liquidity needs.
• In 2022, cash provided resulted from higher accounts
payable and other liabilities, lower securities borrowed,
and net proceeds from sales, securitizations, and
paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher
trading assets.
• In 2021, cash provided resulted from lower trading
assets and higher accounts payable and other liabilities,
partially offset by higher securities borrowed and lower
trading liabilities.
Investing activities
The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include
originating held-for-investment loans, investing in the
investment securities portfolio and other short-term
instruments.
• In 2022, cash used resulted from net originations of
loans and higher securities purchased under resale
agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from
investment securities.
• In 2021, cash used resulted from net purchases of
investment securities and higher net originations of
loans, partially offset by lower securities purchased under
resale agreements.
Financing activities
The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer
deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock.
• In 2022, cash used reflected lower deposits, partially
offset by net proceeds from long- and short-term
borrowings.
• In 2021, cash provided reflected higher deposits and net
proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings, partially
offset by a decrease in securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements.
• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of
common stock and cash dividends on common and
preferred stock.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 57
EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP financial measures
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements
appear on pages 159-163. That presentation, which is
referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an
understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of
the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial
statements of other companies.
In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported
basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the
overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide
managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures.
The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed
basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes
certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the
Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an
FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that
receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in
the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities. These financial measures allow
management to assess the comparability of revenue from
year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt
sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to
tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense.
These adjustments have no impact on net income as
reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.
Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial
measures at the Firm and business-segment level because
these other non-GAAP financial measures provide
information to investors about the underlying operational
performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular
business segment, as the case may be, and therefore
facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment
with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to
Business Segment Results on pages 61-80 for additional
information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP
financial measures used by the Firm may not be
comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial
measures used by other companies.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue
excluding CIB Markets
In addition to reviewing net interest income, net yield, and
noninterest revenue on a managed basis, management also
reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets, as shown
below. CIB Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and
Equity Markets. These metrics, which exclude CIB Markets,
are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews
these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s
lending, investing (including asset-liability management)

Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures
Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are calculated as
follows:
Book value per share (“BVPS”)
Common stockholders’ equity at period-end /
Common shares at period-end
Overhead ratio
Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue
ROA
Reported net income / Total average assets
ROE
Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity
ROTCE
Net income* / Average tangible common equity
TBVPS
Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end
* Represents net income applicable to common equity
In addition, the Firm reviews other non-GAAP measures
such as
• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense
excluding Firmwide legal expense, and
• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue
less total noninterest expense.
Management believes that these measures help investors
understand the effect of these items on reported results
and provide an alternative presentation of the Firm’s
performance.
The Firm also reviews the allowance for loan losses to
period-end loans retained excluding trade finance and
conduits, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more
meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 59
TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS
TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e.,
total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related
deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE.
TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by
the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking,
Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate
segment.
The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they
reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are
presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on
pages 58-60 for a definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The
management reporting process that derives business
segment results includes the allocation of certain income
and expense items. The Firm also assesses the level of
capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis.
The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for
segment reporting, and further refinements may be
implemented in future periods. The Firm’s LOBs also
provide various business metrics which are utilized by the
Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing
performance.
Revenue sharing
When business segments join efforts to sell products and
services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the
participating business segments may agree to share
revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally
recognized in the segment responsible for the related
product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s)
involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect
these revenue-sharing agreements.
Expense Allocation
Where business segments use services provided by
corporate support units, or another business segment, the
costs of those services are allocated to the respective
business segments. The expense is generally
allocated based on the actual cost and use of services
provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related
to corporate support units, technology and operations that
are not currently utilized by any LOB, are not allocated to
the business segments and are retained in Corporate.
Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that
would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone
businesses, and other items not aligned with a particular
business segment.
Funds transfer pricing
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the
Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and
Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk
and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.
The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest
rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities
and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the
methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process
are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other
factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest
income to the segments.
As a result of the rising interest rate environment, the cost
of funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities have
generally increased, impacting the business segments’ net
interest income. During the period ended December 31,
2022, this has resulted in higher cost of funds for loans and
contributed to margin expansion on deposits.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 61
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues
and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks
centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate
movements related to the transferred risk in its results.
Refer to Market Risk Management on page 137 for
additional information.
Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of
the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding
unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is
allocated to the reportable business segments, while the
balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The
methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term
debt and preferred stock dividends to the business
segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital
requirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable.
The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included
in a business segment’s net interest income, and net income
is reduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a
business segment’s net income applicable to common
equity.
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for
additional information.
Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is
referred to as equity. The Firm’s allocation methodology
incorporates Basel III Standardized Risk-weighted assets
(“RWA”), Basel III Advanced RWA, the global systemically
important banks (“GSIB”) surcharge, and a simulation of
capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually,
the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital
allocated to the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2023,
the Firm has changed its line of business capital allocations
primarily as a result of updates to the Firm’s capital
requirements and changes in RWA for each LOB.
Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 for additional
information on capital allocation.

2022 compared with 2021
Net income was $14.9 billion, down 29%, reflecting a net
increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a
net benefit in the prior year.
Net revenue was $55.0 billion, an increase of 10%.
Net interest income was $39.9 billion, up 22%,
predominantly driven by:
• margin expansion on higher rates as well as growth in
deposits in Banking & Wealth Management (“BWM”), and
higher revolving loans in Card Services,
partially offset by
• lower NII associated with PPP loan forgiveness in BWM,
and tighter loan spreads in Home Lending.
Noninterest revenue was $15.1 billion, down 13%,
reflecting:
• lower production revenue from lower margins and
volume in Home Lending,
• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline
in volume, and
• lower card income reflecting higher amortization related
to new account origination costs partially offset by higher
annual fees in Card Services, while net interchange
income was relatively flat,
partially offset by
• higher net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting the
absence of a net loss in MSR risk management in the prior
year primarily driven by updates to model inputs related
to prepayment expectations, as well as higher operating
revenue on a higher level of third-party loans serviced,
• higher commissions reflecting travel-related services in
Card Services and increased annuity sales in BWM, and
• higher deposit-related fees due to higher service fee
volume in BWM.
Refer to Note 6 for additional information on card income
and asset management, administration and commissions.
Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and
mortgage fees and related income.
Noninterest expense was $31.5 billion, up 8%, reflecting:
• investments in the business and higher structural
expenses, predominantly driven by compensation,
technology and marketing,
 partially offset by
• lower volume- and revenue-related expenses,
predominantly driven by lower depreciation expense on
lower auto lease assets, partially offset by higher
operating losses.
The provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion, driven by:
• net charge-offs of $2.7 billion, down from $2.8 billion in
the prior year and included
– a $309 million decrease in Card Services, reflecting the
ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However,
median deposit balances declined in the second half of
2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending,
largely offset by
– a $190 million increase in net charge-offs in Auto and
BWM as net charge-offs in the prior year benefited
from government stimulus and payment assistance
programs, and
• a $1.1 billion net addition to the allowance for credit
losses driven by
– $950 million in Card Services, reflecting higher
outstanding balances, and deterioration in the Firm’s
macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction
in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty
associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the
pandemic gradually recede, and
– $175 million in Home Lending.
The prior year included a $9.8 billion reduction in the
allowance for credit losses across CCB.

106-130 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages

(a) At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, nonaccrual loans excluded
mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S.
government agencies of $187 million, $342 million and $558 million,
respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the
government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to
exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as
permitted by regulatory guidance.
(b) At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, generally excludes loans that
were under payment deferral programs offered in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 for
further information on consumer assistance. Includes loans to
customers that have exited COVID-19 related payment deferral
programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which
were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.
(c) At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, included $350 million, $5.4
billion and $19.2 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking
under the PPP. The Firm does not expect to realize material credit

2022 compared with 2021
Net income was $15.0 billion, down 29%.
Net revenue was $47.9 billion, down 7%.
Banking revenue was $15.3 billion, down 23%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $6.5 billion, down 48%,
driven by lower Investment Banking fees, which were also
down 48%, as volatile market conditions resulted in
lower fees across products, and $251 million of
markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily
unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio
in the second quarter of 2022. The Firm ranked #1 for
Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.
– Equity underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, down 74%,
and debt underwriting fees were $2.8 billion, down
43%, due to lower issuance activity.
– Advisory fees were $3.1 billion, down 30%, driven by a
lower level of announced deals.
• Payments revenue was $7.4 billion, up 18%, and
included the net impact of equity investments. Excluding
this net impact, revenue was $7.8 billion, up 33%, driven
by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth
in fees on higher volumes.
• Lending revenue was $1.4 billion, up 38%, driven by
higher net interest income primarily on higher loans, as
well as fair value gains on hedges of retained loans,
compared with losses in the prior year.
Markets & Securities Services revenue was $32.6 billion, up
2%. Markets revenue was $29.0 billion, up 6%.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $18.6 billion, up
10%, driven by strong performance in the macro
businesses amid volatile market conditions, particularly
in Currencies & Emerging Markets and Rates, partially
offset by lower revenue in Securitized Products.
• Equity Markets revenue was $10.4 billion, down 2%,
driven by lower revenue in Cash Equities, largely offset by
Equity Derivatives.
• Securities Services revenue was $4.5 billion, up 4%,
driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and
growth in fees, largely offset by lower average market
values of assets under custody and lower deposits.
• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $836 million,
reflecting funding spread widening, and, to a lesser
extent, losses on exposures relating to commodities and
Russia and Russia-associated counterparties, compared
with a gain of $250 million in the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $27.1 billion, up 7%, driven by
higher structural expense and investments in the business,
including higher compensation, partially offset by lower
revenue-related compensation as well as lower legal
expense.
The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion,
predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for
credit losses, reflecting deterioration in the Firm’s
macroeconomic outlook and loan growth.
The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net
benefit of $1.2 billion, driven by a net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue
consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm
assesses its Markets business performance on a total
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line
items. For example, securities that generate net interest
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are
reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue.
Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition
of these income statement line items.
Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial
instruments and commodities transactions that arise from
client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions
revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new
transactions with market participants, as well as “inventoryrelated revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains
and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the
Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to,
client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments
used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure
arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue
recognized upon executing new transactions with market
participants is affected by many factors including the level
of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the
difference between the price at which a market participant
is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the
price at which another market participant is willing and able
to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity
and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive
to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue,
which include general market conditions, such as interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity
and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic
conditions.
Management’s discussion and analysis

Net income $ 4,213 $ 5,246 $ 2,578
(a) Includes card income of $685 million, $624 million and $525 million
for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.
(b) Total net revenue included tax-equivalent adjustments from income
tax credits related to equity investments in designated community
development entities and in entities established for rehabilitation of
historic properties, as well as tax-exempt income related to municipal
financing activities of $322 million, $330 million and $350 million for
the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
2022 compared with 2021
Net income was $4.2 billion, down 20%, reflecting a net
increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a
net benefit in the prior year.
Net revenue was $11.5 billion, up 15%. Net interest
income was $8.2 billion, up 35%, driven by deposit margin
expansion on higher rates and growth in loans,
predominantly offset by the impact of higher funding costs
and lower deposits.
Noninterest revenue was $3.3 billion, down 15%, driven by
lower investment banking revenue and net markdowns on
held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in
the bridge financing portfolio. The decreases were partially
offset by a gain on an equity method investment received in
partial satisfaction of a loan.
Noninterest expense was $4.7 billion, up 17%, largely
driven by higher volume-and revenue-related expense, as
well as structural expense, including higher compensation
expense, and expense associated with growth in payments.
The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion,
predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for
credit losses, reflecting deterioration in the Firm’s
macroeconomic outlook and loan growth.
The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net
benefit of $947 million, driven by a net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses.

Net revenue was $17.7 billion, up 5%. Net interest income
was $5.2 billion, up 35%. Noninterest revenue was $12.5
billion, down 4%.
Revenue from Asset Management was $8.8 billion, down
5%, predominantly driven by:
• net investment valuation losses compared to net gains in
the prior year and,
• lower asset management fees reflecting a decline in
market levels and the impact of net liquidity outflows,
predominantly offset by the removal of most money
market fund fee waivers.
Revenue from Global Private Bank was $8.9 billion, up
16%, driven by:
• margin expansion on higher rates and higher average
deposits; and to a lesser extent higher average loans and
wider spreads,
partially offset by
• lower brokerage and placement fees on reduced volume,
and lower management fees.
Noninterest expense was $11.8 billion, up 8%, driven by
higher structural expense and investments in the business,
largely compensation.
The provision for credit losses was $128 million, driven by a
net addition to the allowance for credit losses.
The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net
benefit of $227 million driven by a net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses.
Management’s discussion and analysis
76 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K
Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance.
• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds
rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on
their risk adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating
is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked
funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industrywide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of
industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and
represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall
Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the
performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- year (if
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds,
separate star ratings are provided at the individual share
class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year riskadjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of
history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All
ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to
derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate
asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star
ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a
“primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other
funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the
fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of
future results.
• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds
ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years):All
quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values
used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating
providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute
return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is
based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share
class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong
SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance
data may have been different if all share classes had been included.
Past performance is not indicative of future results.
“Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and
Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share
classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary
share class.

for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,

(b) Predominantly relates to the Firm's international consumer growth
initiatives.
2022 compared with 2021
Net loss was $743 million, compared with a net loss of $3.7
billion in the prior year.
Net revenue was $80 million, compared with a loss of $3.5
billion driven by higher net interest income due to higher
rates, partially offset by lower noninterest revenue.
Noninterest revenue was a loss of $1.8 billion, compared
with a gain of $68 million driven by:
• higher net investment securities losses on sales of U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS, and U.S. Treasuries
associated with repositioning the investment securities
portfolio,
• the impact of movements in foreign exchange on certain
revenues, primarily as result of the U.S. dollar
strengthening,
• net losses related to cash deployment transactions, which
were more than offset by the related net interest income
earned on those transactions,
• net losses, including hedging costs on an equity method
investment related to the Firm's international consumer
growth initiatives, and
• net losses on certain legacy private equity investments
compared with net gains in prior year.
partially offset by
• a gain on the sale of Visa B shares. In connection with the
sale, the Firm entered into a derivative instrument with
the purchaser of the shares under which the Firm retains
the risk associated with changes in the rate at which the
shares are convertible into Visa Class A common shares
(“Visa A shares”). Refer to Note 2 for additional
information,
• higher net gains related to certain Other Corporate
investments, and
• proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first
quarter of 2022.
Noninterest expense was $1.0 billion, down $768 million,
predominantly driven by:
• lower structural expense reflecting the impact of
movements in foreign exchange on certain expenses
primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening, and
lower retained technology expense, and
• a lower contribution to the Firm’s Foundation.
partially offset by
• higher investments, including the costs associated with
the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.
The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates
associated with the foreign exchange risk that is transferred
to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses was
not material to net income. Refer to Foreign Exchange Risk
on page 62 for additional information.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 79
Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on
the investment securities portfolio and the allowance for
credit losses.
The current period income tax benefit was driven by
benefits related to tax audit settlements as well as other tax
adjustments, partially offset by a change in the level and
mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and
state and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax
reserves.
Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's international
consumer growth initiatives, which include Chase U.K., the
Firm's digital retail bank in the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital
wealth manager in the U.K.; and a 40% ownership stake in
C6 Bank, a digital bank in Brazil, which closed in the first

measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s
liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and
foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by Treasury and
CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four
major reportable business segments to serve their
respective client bases, which generate both on- and offbalance sheet assets and liabilities.
Treasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability
management objectives generally by investing in highquality securities that are managed for the longer-term as
part of the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Treasury
and CIO also uses derivatives to meet the Firm’s assetliability management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further
information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO
manages the Firm’s cash position primarily through
deposits at central banks and investments in short-term
instruments. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
97-104 for further information on liquidity and funding
risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 131-138
for information on interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
The investment securities portfolio predominantly consists
of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, U.S. GSE and
government agency and nonagency mortgage-backed
securities, collateralized loan obligations, obligations of U.S.
states and municipalities and other ABS. At December 31,
2022, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio,
net of the allowance for credit losses, was $629.3 billion,
and the average credit rating of the securities comprising
the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available and, where not available, based primarily upon
internal risk ratings). Refer to Note 10 for further
information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio
and internal risk ratings.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its business, and
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the
interests of its clients, customers and investors, and
protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm.
The Firm believes that effective risk management requires,
among other things:
• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and
escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;
• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and
management within each of the LOBs and Corporate;
and
• A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.
The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation
framework with strong internal governance and
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and
incentive compensation processes.
Risk governance framework
The Firm’s risk governance framework involves
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of
risks.
Drivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers
of risks include, but are not limited to, the economic
environment, regulatory or government policy, competitor
or market evolution, business decisions, process or
judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional
markets, and natural disasters.
Types of risks are categories by which risks manifest
themselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized in
the following four risk types:
• Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed
business plans or inadequate responses to changes in
the operating environment.
• Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the
default or change in credit profile of a client,
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a
reduction in expected returns on investments, including
consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and
investment portfolio risk.
• Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of
changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and
liabilities held for both the short and long term.
• Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or
systems; human factors; or external events impacting
the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational risk
includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and
model risk.
Impacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative
and qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks
manifesting, including quantitative impacts such as a
reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and
fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to
the Firm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers, and
regulatory and enforcement actions.
The Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on a
Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk
Management (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of Risk
Management and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief Executive
Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by the Risk
Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board Risk
Committee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead
the IRM function and maintain the risk governance
framework of the Firm. The framework is subject to
approval by the Board Risk Committee through its review
and approval of the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy.
The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to the
Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk Officers of
the LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and the Firm’s Chief
Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in turn, establish Risk
Management and Compliance organizations, develop the
Firm’s risk governance policies and standards, and define
and oversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk
governance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that
arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks
that span across the LOBs and Corporate, functions and
regions. Each area of the Firm giving rise to risk is expected
to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM
function, and within its own management-identified risk and
control standards.
Three lines of defense
The Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as follows:
The first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury and
CIO, and certain Other Corporate initiatives, including their
aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management.
The first line of defense own the identification of risks
within their respective organizations and the design and
execution of controls to manage those risks.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 81
Responsibilities also include adherence to applicable laws,
rules and regulations and implementation of the risk
governance framework established by IRM, which may
include policies, standards, limits, thresholds and controls.
The second line of defense is the IRM function, which is
separate from, and independently assesses and challenges,
the first line of defense risk management practices. IRM is
also responsible for the identification of risks within its
respective organization, adherence to applicable laws, rules
and regulations and for the development and
implementation of policies and standards with respect to its
own processes.
The third line of defense is Internal Audit, an independent
function that provides objective assessment of the
adequacy and effectiveness of Firmwide processes,
controls, governance and risk management. The Internal
Audit function is headed by the General Auditor, who
reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the
CEO.
In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the
Firmwide control environment but are not considered part
of a particular line of defense, including Finance, Human
Resources and Legal. These other functions are responsible
for the identification of risks within their respective
organizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and
regulations and implementation of the risk governance
framework established by IRM.
Risk identification and ownership
The LOBs and Corporate own the identification of risks
within their respective organizations, as well as the design
and execution of controls, including IRM-specified controls,
to manage those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has
a risk identification framework designed to facilitate each
LOB and Corporate’s responsibility to identify material risks
inherent to the Firm’s business and operational activities,
catalog them in a central repository and review material
risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews and
challenges the LOB and Corporate’s identified risks,
maintains the central repository and provides the
consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk
Committee (“FRC”) and the Board Risk Committee.
Risk appetite
The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by “Risk
Appetite” frameworks for quantitative and qualitative risks.
Periodically the Firm’s risk appetite is set and approved by
senior management (including the CEO and CRO) and
approved by the Board Risk Committee. Quantitative and
qualitative risks are assessed to monitor and measure the
Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk
appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board
Risk Committee.
Management’s discussion and analysis
82 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K
Risk governance and oversight structure
The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a risk governance and oversight structure that provides channels
for the escalation of risks and issues to senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate.
The chart below illustrates the committees of the Board of Directors and key senior management-level committees in the
Firm’s risk governance and oversight structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and channels of escalation
that support the oversight of risk that are not shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K.
The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the
Firm’s CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), General
Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior executives, is
accountable to and may refer matters to the Firm’s Board of
Directors. The Operating Committee is responsible for
escalating to the Board the information necessary to
facilitate the Board’s exercise of its duties.
Board oversight
The Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the business
and affairs of the Firm. This includes monitoring the Firm’s
financial performance and condition and reviewing the
strategic objectives and plans of the Firm. The Board carries
out a significant portion of its oversight responsibilities
through its principal standing committees, each of which
consists solely of independent members of the Board. The
Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that
oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the
control environment, and the Compensation & Management
Development Committee oversees compensation and other
management-related matters. Each committee of the Board
oversees reputational risks, conduct risks, and ESG matters
within its scope of responsibility.
The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is
responsible for the oversight of management of the bank,
which it discharges both acting directly and through the
principal standing committees of the Firm’s Board of
Directors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan
Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the Board
Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and,
with respect to compensation and other managementrelated matters, the Compensation & Management
Development Committee.
The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight
of management’s responsibility to implement a global risk
management framework reasonably designed to identify,
assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk
Committee’s responsibilities include approval of applicable
primary risk policies and review of certain associated
frameworks, analysis and reporting established by
management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters,
issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm,
including capital and liquidity issues, and other significant
risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk
Committee, as appropriate.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of
management’s responsibility to ensure that there is an
effective system of controls reasonably designed to
safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the
integrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and maintain
compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards, policies, plans
and procedures, and with laws and regulations. It also
assists the Board in its oversight of the qualifications,
independence and performance of the Firm’s independent
registered public accounting firm, and of the performance
of the Firm’s Internal Audit function.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 83
The Compensation & Management Development Committee
(“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s
compensation principles and practices. The CMDC reviews
and approves the Firm’s compensation and qualified
benefits programs. The Committee reviews the performance
of Operating Committee members against their goals, and
approves their compensation awards. In addition, the CEO’s
award is subject to ratification by the independent directors
of the Board. The CMDC also reviews the development of
and succession for key executives. As part of the Board’s
role of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the
“tone at the top,” the CMDC oversees the Firm’s culture,
including reviewing updates from management regarding
significant conduct issues and any related actions with
respect to employees, including compensation actions.
The Public Responsibility Committee oversees and reviews
the Firm's positions and practices on public responsibility
matters such as community investment, fair lending,
sustainability, consumer practices and other public policy
issues that reflect the Firm's values and character and could
impact the Firm's reputation among its stakeholders. The
Committee also provides guidance on these matters to
management and the Board, as appropriate.
The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee
exercises general oversight with respect to the governance
of the Board of Directors. It reviews the qualifications of
and recommends to the Board proposed nominees for
election to the Board. The Committee evaluates and
recommends to the Board corporate governance practices
applicable to the Firm. It also reviews the framework for
assessing the Board’s performance and self-evaluation.
Management oversight
The Firm’s senior management-level committees that are
primarily responsible for key risk-related functions include:
The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s highest
management-level risk committee. It oversees the risks
inherent in the Firm’s business and provides a forum for
discussion of topics, and issues that are raised or escalated
by its members and other committees.
The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an escalation
committee for senior management to review and discuss
the Firmwide operational risk environment including
identified issues, operational risk metrics and significant
events that have been escalated.
Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are
responsible for overseeing the governance, limits, and
controls that have been established within the scope of
their respective activities. These committees review the
ways in which the particular LOB or the businesses
operating in a particular region could be exposed to
adverse outcomes, with a focus on identifying, accepting,
escalating and/or requiring remediation of matters brought
to these committees.
Line of Business and Corporate Function Control Committees
oversee the operational risk and control environment of
their respective business or function, inclusive of
Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part of
that mandate, they are responsible for reviewing indicators
of elevated or emerging risks and other data that may
impact the level of operational risk in a business or
function, addressing key operational risk issues, with an
emphasis on processes with control concerns and
overseeing control remediation.
The Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for
overseeing the Firm’s asset and liability management
(“ALM”), including the activities and frameworks supporting
management of the balance sheet, liquidity risk, interest
rate risk, and capital risk.
The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is
composed of senior finance and risk executives and is
responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising
from valuation activities conducted across the Firm.
Risk governance and oversight functions
The Firm manages its risk through risk governance and
oversight functions. The scope of a particular function or
business activity may include one or more drivers, types
and/or impacts of risk. For example, Country Risk
Management oversees country risk which may be a driver of
risk or an aggregation of exposures that could give rise to
multiple risk types such as credit or market risk.
The following sections discuss the risk governance and
oversight functions that have been established to manage
the risks inherent in the Firm’s business activities.

STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed
business plans or inadequate responses to changes in the
operating environment.
Management and oversight
The Operating Committee, together with the senior
leadership of each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for
managing the Firm’s most significant strategic risks. IRM
engages regularly in strategic business discussions and
decision-making, including participation in relevant
business reviews and senior management meetings, risk
and control committees and other relevant governance
forums, and acquisition and new business initiative reviews.
The Board of Directors oversees management’s strategic
decisions, and the Board Risk Committee oversees IRM and
the Firm’s risk governance framework.
In the process of developing business plans and strategic
initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior management identify
the associated risks that are incorporated into the Firmwide
Risk Identification framework and their impact on risk
appetite.
In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the
LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their
impact on the risk profile of the Firm.
The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes the
development of the Firm’s strategic plan and other strategic
initiatives, is one component of managing the Firm’s
strategic risk. The strategic plan outlines the Firm’s
strategic framework and initiatives, and includes
components such as budget, risk appetite, capital, earnings
and asset-liability management objectives. Guided by the
Firm’s How We Do Business Principles, the Operating
Committee and senior management teams in each LOB and
Corporate review and update the strategic plan periodically,
including evaluating the strategic framework and
performance against prior-year initiatives, assessing the
operating environment, refining existing strategies and
developing new strategies.
The Firm’s strategic plan, together with IRM’s assessment,
are provided to the Board as part of its review and approval
of the Firm’s strategic plan, and the plan is also reflected in
the Firm's budget.
The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on riskadjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity, is also
a component in the management of strategic risk. Refer to
Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for further
information on capital risk. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 97-104 for further information on
liquidity risk. Refer to Reputation Risk Management on page
105 for further information on reputation risk.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 85
CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business
activities and associated risks during normal economic
environments and under stressed conditions.
A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business
strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong
balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is
considered a strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of
Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm’s
fortress balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted
returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s
capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining
long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in
market-leading businesses, including in highly stressed
environments. Senior management considers the
implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making significant
decisions that could impact future business activities. In
addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior
management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with
a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength.
Capital risk management
The Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose
primary objective is to provide independent oversight of
capital risk across the Firm.
Capital Risk Management’s responsibilities include:
• Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;
• Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk
limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;
• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report
capital limit breaches;
• Performing an assessment of the Firm’s capital
management activities, including changes made to the
Contingency Capital Plan described below; and
• Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital
framework intended to ensure compliance with
applicable regulatory capital rules.
Capital management
Treasury and CIO is responsible for capital management.
The primary objectives of the Firm’s capital management
are to:
• Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build
and invest in the Firm’s businesses through the cycle
and in stressed environments;
• Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment
opportunities;
• Promote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of
strength to its subsidiaries;
• Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory
capital ratios as well as maintain “well-capitalized”
status for the Firm and its insured depository institution
(“IDI”) subsidiaries at all times under applicable
regulatory capital requirements;
• Meet capital distribution objectives; and
• Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate
throughout a resolution period in accordance with the
Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.
The Firm addresses these objectives through:
• Establishing internal minimum capital requirements and
maintaining a strong capital governance framework. The
internal minimum capital levels consider the Firm’s
regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal
assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic
cycles and in stress events;
• Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of
potential events; and
• Regular monitoring of the Firm’s capital position and
following prescribed escalation protocols, both at the
Firm and material legal entity levels.
Governance
Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s capital
management include the Capital Governance Committee,
the Firmwide ALCO and LOB and regional ALCOs, and the
CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) Risk Committee. In
addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the
Firm’s capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk
Management on pages 81-84 for additional discussion of
the Firmwide ALCO and other risk-related committees.
Capital planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
The Federal Reserve requires large Bank Holding
Companies (“BHCs”), including the Firm, to submit at least
annually a capital plan that has been reviewed and
approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve
uses Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”)
and other stress testing processes to ensure that large BHCs
have sufficient capital during periods of economic and
financial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital
assessment and planning processes in place that address
each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under
certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve
evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and internal capital
adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as well as its
plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend
payments or stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve uses
results under the severely adverse scenario from its
supervisory stress test to determine each firm’s Stress
Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement for the coming year.
On June 27, 2022, the Firm announced that it had
completed the Federal Reserve's 2022 CCAR stress test
process. On August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve affirmed
the Firm's 2022 SCB requirement of 4.0% (up from 3.2%),
and the Firm’s Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement,
including regulatory buffers, of 12.0% (up from 11.2%).
The 2022 SCB requirement became effective on October 1,
2022, and will remain in effect until September 30, 2023.
Management’s discussion and analysis
86 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K
Refer to Capital actions on page 94 for information on
actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors.
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process
Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the
Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm’s
processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as
well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital
planning and capital adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates
stress testing protocols with capital planning. The Firm’s
Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving
the capital planning framework.
Stress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative
economic and business scenarios on the Firm’s earnings
and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters
underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and
applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios
are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which
are key drivers of business results; global market shocks,
which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and
idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are
intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and
idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to CCAR and
other periodic stress testing, management also considers
tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as
necessary.
Contingency Capital Plan
The Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital
management framework for the Firm and specifies the
principles underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital
management in normal economic conditions and in stressed
environments. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how
the Firm calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets
minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing
appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets
out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be
taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion
during a period of stress.
Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated
financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar
minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s
IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The
U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital
Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to
time.
